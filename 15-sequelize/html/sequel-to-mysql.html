      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Good morning all! Last session was hectic, plus the entirety of the Handlebars unit was pretty advanced. Before we even get into today's
        lesson, it should be said that for all the difficult activities, frustration at non-working application components, and time crunches,
        everyone is still doing awesome. I'd like to take this time to remind you that <span class="note italic">what you're doing is hard</span>
        and you deserve as much credit and praise as you can get. Well done!
      </p>
      <p>Building on the admittedly complicated ORM+MVC concepts we went through last time, today's lesson will introduce you to a helpful tool
        that will assist you in remaining on top of your MySQL. There is a learning curve, however&mdash;there is new documentation for you to digest.
        After that, it should be smooth sailing. If it isn't, your instructional staff is here to help!
      </p>

      <h1>Review</h1>
      <p>Recall that the <span class="note"><abbr title="Model-View-Controller">MVC</abbr> (Model-View-Controller)</span> is a framework
      for developing applications, one that focuses on clear dividing lines between how the data is used, how it is displayed to the user, and how
      it is manipulated. In short:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Model represents the application core (our database and its hook to our back-end).</li>
        <li>The View displays the data (our HTML routes and the public files).</li>
        <li>The Controller handles the input to our database
          (accepting input from the view, sending it to the model, taking a response from the model, and sending it back to the view.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let's do a review MySQL activity to get started.</p>
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>Chirpy</h3>
        <p>I'll demo this app for you, then you will build it.</p>
        <p>Using the app skeleton provided to you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a MySQL database named <span class='mono'>chirpy</span> with a <span class='mono'>chirps</span> table to hold your data.</li>
          <li>Your <span class='mono'>chirp</span> table should include a field for id, author, chirp, and time created.</li>
          <li>Modify the <span class="mono">connection.js</span> file to create a connection to your database.</li>
          <li>Modify the <span class="mono">api-routes.js</span> file so that there is a route for adding a new chirp, as well as retrieving all chirps.</li>
          <li>Modify the <span class="mono">chirps.js</span> file so that the page interacts with the database.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you find yourself with extra time, work on routes for editing and deleting chirps.</p>

      <div class="review">

        <p>Let's go over this application relatively quickly.</p>

      <h1>Introduction to Sequelize</h1>
      <p>While the Chirpy app you just created is functional, there's a way to make it work with our database with a lot less hassle. It might take time to learn,
        and this unit will be a tough one, but this tool is going to take you from beginners to truly adept MySQL coders
        We're speaking of <span class="note">Sequelize</span> of course; the <a href="http://http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/">Sequelize docs</a> can
        help us quite a bit with learning it, just like with most APIs and frameworks we've encountered.</p>
       <h2>What is Sequelize?</h2>
       <p>Sequelize is a premade ORM that simplifies database queries in Node applications, allowing us to do complex data management with simple
          JavaScript methods&mdash;much, much simpler than the ORMs we used last time, despite their simplicity. Today, we'll be focusing on getting Sequelize
          set up on your machines and navigating a Sequelize project.</p>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Partner activity!</h2>
          <h3>Sequelize Quiz</h3>
          <p>Take a look at <span class="mono">02-SequelizeQuestions</span> with a partner. Each group will need to come up with answers to the questions in the quiz.</p>
          <p>Feel free to use the Sequelize documentation as well as any info you may find on the usual sites (stack overflow, quora, etc.) to answer these questions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="review">
          <h2>Sequelize Quiz Answers</h2>
          <p>Let's go through the answers to these questions one-by-one, seeing how your new knowledge stacks up.</p>
          <p>After that and just for fun, let's try to answer an old question...</p>
          <blockquote>How would you define full-stack development?</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>Now that we've had some time to poke through the documentation for Sequelize, let's take a look at it in action using a different
          version of the solved Chirpy app. We'll be taking note of the key differences between Sequelize and stock MySQL.

          <h3>Star Wars MySQL to Sequelize</h3>
          <p>Now, it's your turn to get your hands dirty with Sequelize! I'll demonstrate its functionality, the you'll convert it to use the new framework.</p>
          <p>Using the instructions in server.js, reconfigure the Star Wars app to use the Sequelize ORM.</p>
          <p>If you need help, refer to the previous example for guidance.</p>

        <div class="review">

          <p>Let's point out the key differences and advantages of the converted Sequelize version.</p>
