      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Good evening, class! Today's class will both test and enrich your understanding of clients and servers in Node.
        From being able to host applications to handling HTTP requests, Node servers are incredibly versatile. It is no
        coincidence that it has quickly become an industry favorite. Knowledge of Node servers is incredibly
        marketable right now, as are frameworks such as Express, templating engines, etc. 
      </p>
      <p>Today's class will be one of several <span class="italic accent">very difficult</span>
      classes over the next few weeks, breaking into true full-stack development, as opposed to
      strictly frontend.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>How Servers Work <span class="italic">(In Brief)</span></h1>
      <p>Before we even begin, it should be stressed that Node and Express routing and servers are two of the most
        important concepts we'll cover in this class. If you feel like we're going too quickly and need to slow down,
        <span class="italic">you are encouraged</span> to slow it down and ask plenty of questions.
      </p>
      <h2>Quick Refresher: What is a Server?</h2>
      <p>As a reminder, a server refers to either a machine, set of running processes or both
        that handle requests and give back responses. If you make a <code>GET</code> request to a server, it sees that
        you asked for something, it determines what you want, and does something with that. All webservers do this.
        It is what allows you to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Visit a URL and get back an HTML page complete with styles, files and other media</li>
            <li>Make a request to an API end-point with URL parameters, receiving JSON in return</li>
            <li>Generating a PDF report in-broswer</li>
            <li>Image processing webapp that takes an image, manipulates it, then saves a new version</li>
            <li>Provide search results for various queries</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>...What is a client?</h2>
      <p>Your computer is a client; phones, wearable devices, game consoles, Raspberry Pis,
        smart-enabled home devicesâ€”<span class="bold">everything</span> that can make requests to a server is a client.
        Users use clients (browsers, frontends, etc.) to talk to servers by way of HTTP/S requests; servers
        <span class="italic">serve</span> what is asked for by following server-side logic. Normally,
        these are considered two separate machines. However, servers can be hosted anywhere:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Server racks (hardware)</li>
          <li>Virtual machines</li>
          <li>PaaS (AWS, Heroku, Google Cloud Services)</li>
          <li>Simulated locally (you'll be doing this today!)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How do I "create" a server?</h2>
        <p>After you figure out how you want to host it, there is still the task of writing
          the code that handles what the server will actually <span class="italic">do</span>.
          So, you'll have to figure out:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Database connections</li>
          <li>Client-side URL requests
            <span class="muted">(routing fits in here. Sort of.)</span></li>
          <li>Server-side processes</li>
          <li>Authenticating user requests</li>
          <li>Logging client requests</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Visualize a server like this:</h3>
        <p><span class="note">A big, empty box.</span> We'll add in code snippets and modules to respond to
          requests in ways we desire.
        </p>
        <p><span class="note">Add a listener.</span> Thus, the server can listen for requests.</p>
        <p><span class="note">URL parsing</span> should be next. We can decide what the user sent us.</p>
        <p><span class="note">Routing based on URLs</span> allows us to direct the flow of logic.</p>
        <p><span class="note">Send HTML</span> or
          <span class="note">send JSON</span> as a response.</p>
        <p><span class="note">POST request data</span> should be parsed and used.</p>
        <p><span class="note">Server-side logic</span> can be as complex as we wish based on
          how we want to respond to users accessing certain routes and giving us data.</p>
        <p><span class="bold mid-accent">Much, much, much more.</span> As much stuff
        as we want to add to this box.</p>

        <h2>Questions, comments, concerns before we begin?</h2>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Running a Server</h2>
      <p>Now that you're a little more familiar with what we want to do and why, let's 
        immediately start with an example. This example will allow us to do something really cool:
        make requests to a Node server running locally. 
      </p>
      <div class="activity">
        <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
        <p>You don't have to copy exactly what I'm doing, but feel free to follow along if you like.</p>
        <p>We need the built-in <code>http</code> package for this&mdash;everything else is just logic.</p>
        <p>When it's up I'll make a request from my terminal, then do something cooler...</p>
      </div>
      <div class="review">
        <h2>Questions? More detail?</h2>
        <p>Ask away!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>Running Two Servers</h3>
        <p>Using the previous example as a guide, create an app that has two web servers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One that listens on <span class="accent">port 7000</span> and one that listens on <span class="mid-accent">port 7500</span>.</li>
          <li>The one listening on <span class="accent">port 7000</span> will always tell the user something good about themselves.</li>
          <li>The one listening on <span class="mid-accent">port 7500</span> will always tell the user something bad about themselves.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Create a Github repo and commit this code.</p>
        <p><span class="bonus">Bonus:</span> Look for other ways to expand what your server can do. As a possibility:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Generate the good/bad phrase randomly from a list of predefined phrases
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

    <section>
      <h1>URL Parsing and Routing</h1>
      <p>Now that we've gotten servers up and running, the next portion of our class will be focused on how to specify different behavior based on
        what URL we get from a request&mdash;this is absolutely vital for everything from creating APIs that return JSON to rendering
        different webpages. This is a different way to think about how webpages are rendered: instead of the old-fashioned "directory structure"
        metaphor traditionally used to represent a site, we don't have to have separate directories and files. Instead, we return whatever we feel like
        based on URLs we intend on accepting and parsing. This is one of the major advantages of routing.</p>
      <div class="activity">
        <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
        <p>I'm going to walk through a basic url parsing and routing example.</p>
        <p>The exact syntax of this example isn't what's important. However, you should take the time necessary
        to understand what is happening here at a conceptual level.</p>
        <p>I'll go over this and then we'll spend some time for questions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="review">
        <h2>URL Parsing and Routing Discussion</h2>
        <p>Ask questions if you're not sure about anything we just went over.</p>
        <p>Explain back to me what's going on in this example.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="activity">
        <h2>Another instructor activity...</h2>
        <p>We'll be doing another example. This example will focus on serving HTML using <code>fs</code>.</p>
        <p>I'll demo using my browser, but first we'll look at the code. What do you think will happen?</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>Serve-Favorites</h3>
        <p>Create a website with four routes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Home</li>
          <li>Favorite Food</li>
          <li>Favorite Movies</li>
          <li>Favorite CSS Frameworks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each route should be triggered by a different URL.</p>
        <p>Each route should display an HTML page listing your favorite three things of each.</p>
        <p>Be sure to use <code>fs</code> to serve your HTML files.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Request Methods</h1>
      <p>Up until now, all of the previous examples have been built using <span class="mono">GET</span> requests.
        Every single URL we've visited using our browser? <span class="mono">GET</span> requests.
        When you visit almost <span class="italic">any</span> URL in your browser? You know what it is. We've talked about other
        request methods briefly in the past, but let's get everyone introduced others such as <span class="mono">POST</span>,
        <span class="mono">PUT</span>, and <span class="mono">DELETE</span>.</p>
      <div class="activity">
        <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
        <p>I'm going to show you an app that logs the type of requests it receives.</p>
        <p>For this example, I'll be using an app called <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a>. It's a free application interface for performing HTTP
        requests and is super awesome. Install the desktop application, not the browser component. This app is highly recommended.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can use the built-in command <code>curl</code> to do this. It's a little trickier but works just as well:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -X GET -d "firstName=james" http://localhost:8080
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -X POST -d "firstName=james" http://localhost:8080
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -X PUT -d "firstName=james" http://localhost:8080
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -X DELETE -d "firstName=james" http://localhost:8080</code></pre>
         <p>This is a concept you'll be fleshing out over the course of this week.</p>
