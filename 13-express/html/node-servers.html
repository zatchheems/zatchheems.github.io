      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Good evening, class! Today's class will both test and enrich your understanding of clients and servers in Node.
        From being able to host applications to handling HTTP requests, Node servers are incredibly versatile. It is no
        coincidence that it has quickly become an industry favorite. Knowledge of Node servers is incredibly
        marketable right now, as are frameworks such as Express, templating engines, etc. 
      </p>
      <p>Today's class will be one of several <span class="italic accent">very difficult</span>
      classes over the next few weeks, breaking into true full-stack development, as opposed to
      strictly frontend.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>How Servers Work <span class="italic">(In Brief)</span></h1>
      <p>Before we even begin, it should be stressed that Node and Express routing and servers are two of the most
        important concepts we'll cover in this class. If you feel like we're going too quickly and need to slow down,
        <span class="italic">you are encouraged</span> to slow it down and ask plenty of questions.
      </p>
      <h2>Quick Refresher: What is a Server?</h2>
      <p>As a reminder, a server refers to either a machine, set of running processes or both
        that handle requests and give back responses. If you make a <code>GET</code> request to a server, it sees that
        you asked for something, it determines what you want, and does something with that. All webservers do this.
        It is what allows you to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Visit a URL and get back an HTML page complete with styles, files and other media</li>
            <li>Make a request to an API end-point with URL parameters, receiving JSON in return</li>
            <li>Generating a PDF report in-broswer</li>
            <li>Image processing webapp that takes an image, manipulates it, then saves a new version</li>
            <li>Provide search results for various queries</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
