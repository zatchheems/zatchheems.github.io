        <p>Today is an extremely activity-dense lesson. We will be going over
          a few very critical topics that will require a lot of practice.
        </p>
        <p>First, we review!</p>

          <h2>What exactly
            <span class='italic'>is</span> Javascript?</h2>
          <p>JS is what we use to
            <span class='bold gray'>do things</span>.
          <p>In short:</p>
          <p>HTML &RightArrow; content</p>
          <p>CSS &RightArrow; style</p>
          <p>JS &RightArrow; interactivity</p>
          <h2>Variables</h2>
          <p>Syntax: <span class='property'>var</span>
            <span class='selector'><span class='selector'>myVar</span>
          <span class='special-char'>=</span>
          <span class='value'>2</span><span class='special-char'>;</span>

          <pre class="brush: javascript">

// idea: is Zak wearing a hat today?

var wearingAHat = true;

// string: quote type sometimes does not matter

var motherInsult = "your mother was a hamster";
var fatherInsult = `your father smelt of elderberries`;

// String concatenation with + for an oft-quoted joke

          <p>What do each of the above functions return? How do we store the user's input?</p>
          <p>Another useful function is <code>document.write()</code>, which allows us
          to write text (or HTML!) directly to the browser (the document). We won't be using this
          very much in the future, however.</p>

          <h1>For Loops</h1>
          <p>Sometimes, it can be tedious to look at or modify many things sequentially.</p>
          <p>It can also be a huge time-waster; if we're doing the same thing for multiple
            elements in an array, for example, it would be nice to not have to copy and
            paste the same line <span class='italic'>over</span> and
            <span class='italic'>over</span> again. We can automate repeditive tasks with
            <span class='bold gray'>loops</span>.
          </p>
          <p>Enter the <code>for</code> loop: it's a super common way to run the same line(s)
          of code as many times as we'd like, using a counter to access, output, or 
          manipulate data.</p>
          <p>Syntax:</p>
          <span class='monospace'>
            <span class='selector'>for</span> <span class='special-char'>(</span><span class='value'>[counter]</span><span class='special-char'>;</span>
            <span class='value'>[exit condition]</span><span class='special-char'>;</span>
            <span class='value'>[iterator]</span><span class='special-char'>){</span><span class='gray'>...</span><span class='special-char'>}</span>
          </span>
          <pre class="brush: javascript">
// Output each value of the counter

console.log("Even numbers from 0 to 20: ");

for(var i = 0; i <= 20; i += 2){
  console.log(i);
}

var flowers = [ 'Daffodil', 'Hyacinth', 'Orchid', 'Tulip', 'Hosta' ];

// Example, using flowers array declared earlier.
//  1. Declare a new variable as a counter
//  2. Loop until the counter = length of array
//  3. Increment counter after loop

for(var i = 0; i < flowers.length; i++){
  console.log(flowers[i]+"s? Those are dope.");

          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Let's do some <code>for</code> loop dissection. Grab a partner and explain
            to each other exactly what's going on in a given file. Go line-by-line and make
            sure you know what's happening. Feel free to research if you're stumped.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>For the given example, notice how <code>i</code> changes and allows us
        to move from 0 to <code>length–1</code>. It <span class='bold'>does not</span>
        continue when <code>i</code> equals the length of the array;
        since our condition says to continue only when <code>i < array.length</code>,
        we stop.</p>
        <p>Notice that this is extremely important, since <code>array[array.length]</code>
        is not a viable index.</p>
        <div class='student-activity'>
          <h2>Student activity!<br><small>(another one!)</small></h2>
          <p>Use <code>for</code> loops  to rewrite a given file.

          <p>Once you think your code is functioning properly, share it with the person
            sitting next to you.</p>
          <p><span class="bold gray">Bonus:</span> try doing this with a function!</p>
          <p>Remember that functions take inputs, just like <code>console.log()</code>.
          (As a reminder, this is not something we have covered in-depth yet.)</p>
          <p>Syntax: <pre class="brush: javascript">
function doThing(argument){
  /* do a thing using argument */

        <h1>Browser Events</h1>
        <p>What happens when you...
          <ul>
            <li>move your cursor across the window?</li>
            <li>scroll within the window?</li>
            <li>click within the viewport?</li>
            <li>press any key on your keyboard?</li>
            <li>hover over an element?</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Your browser listens to all of the input that you give it, keeps track of it,
          and can be programmed to respond accordingly. A lot of elements have default
          ways to respond to these <span class='bold gray'>events</span>.
        </p>
        <p>There a couple of ways to get your browser to listen and respond to events, and you can 
          add <span class='bold gray'>event listeners</span> to different elements.</p>
        <p>The most common way to select an element—a <span class="bold gray">DOM node</span>—is
          <code>document.getElementById("elementName")</code>.
          Assign this to a variable and we can do something like the following:</p>
<pre class="brush: javascript">
// Look in the document for an element with ID #myElem.
// Notice that we don't use the pound sign.

var myElem = document.getElementById("myElem");

// We can listen for clicks on the element like so:

myElem.onClick = function(event){
  // I got clicked on!
  // Do a thing!
}

// You can also use a more general syntax:

myElem.addEventListener("click", function(event){
  // Same as above, but more general.
  // We can replace "click" with other events, like
  //  "hover" or "keyPressed".
});

// Here, we want the key pressed anywhere on the page:

document.onkeyup = function(event){
  // We can see the key that got pressed and use it!
  console.log(event.key);
}</pre>
        <p>We can modify DOM nodes on the fly; properties such as <code>textContent</code>
        can be changed for elements that can hold text, styles can be changed, etc.
        Pretty much all of the information a DOM node has is editable!</p>
        <p>Quick demo:</p>
        <button id='click-me'>Click me!</button>
        <pre class="brush: javascript">
// Store button, number of button clicks
 var numClicks = 0;
 var button = document.getElementById("click-me");

// Add an event listener for clicks on button
button.onclick = function(event) {
if (numClicks === 0){
    button.textContent = "Alas! I am clicked!";
    ++numClicks;
  } else if(numClicks === 1) {
    button.textContent = "You continue to click me! Why?";
    ++numClicks;
  } else {
    button.textContent = "Have you no shame?! You clicked me "+
      (numClicks+1)+" times already!";

    ++numClicks;
  }
};
        </pre>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Class activity</h2>
          <p>Let's write an application that lets you play rock, paper, scissors.
            First, let's have a demo of the final product to see what we want to build.
          </p>
          <hr class="line-break">
          <p>We want to use a user's input ("r", "p", or "s") and then have a computer

        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!<br><small>Prep work...</small></h2>
          <p>Before we actually write any code, let's write some pseudocode for notes in 
            a different text file. Do this in partners or groups to make it easier.
          </p>
          <p>Think about what we need for a game of rock, paper, scissors
             and how we can achieve those things.</p>
          <p>Don't worry about exact syntax.
            Break each step into something you can code out, like <code>if</code> statements,
            <code>for</code> loops and event handlers.

          <h2>Student activity!<br><small>The real deal!</small></h2>
          <p>In groups of 4, begin the process of coding out the rock-paper-scissors game.</p>
          <p>Do as much as you can on your own, but don't be afraid to ask for help if you
            feel your team is struggling.</p>

    <p><span class="bold gray">Note:</span> Don't use <code>document.write</code> as it will
      delete the contents of the body, including your JavaScript.</p>
      <p>Instead, use

      property, as you were shown earlier.</p>
    <hr class="line-break">
    <p><span class="bold gray">Note:</span> Don’t worry. We know this is a very challenging

      Part of being a developer is figuring things out on your own through trial and error.
