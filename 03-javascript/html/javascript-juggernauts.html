        <h1>Arrays and Loops Recap</h1>
        <div class='student-activity'>
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Remember how crazy the rock, paper, scissors activity was?
            Forget about that thing.</p>
            <p>For now, let's just focus on arrays and
            <code>for</code> loops.
          </p>
          <p>Open the given file (loop-tv-unsolved.html) in your browser.
          <p>With a partner, fill in the missing comments for each line of code.
            Explain what each line does in a short single-line comment.
            Make sure both of you can fully explain what each line means.
          </p>
          <p>What does <code>.push()</code> do? Think about what type of variable
            uses that method,
            what arguments it takes, etc.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Functions</h1>
        <p>Just like <code>for</code> loops, <span class='bold gray'>functions</span> allow us to
        do a task using a <span class='bold'>reusable block of code</span> with different
        arguments.</p>
        <p>It also allows us to develop with a 
        <abbr class='bold gray' title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr>
        methodology:</p>
        <blockquote>Don't Repeat Yourself!</blockquote>
        <p>This is absolutely huge! Think about keeping your code "DRY"
        and you'll notice how nicely neat and organized things become.
        </p>
        <hr class="line-break">
        <p>Function definition syntax:
          <span class="monospace">
            <span class='property'>function</span>
            <span class='selector'>funcName</span>
            <span class='special-char'>(</span>
            <span class='value'>argument</span><span class='light-gray'>, arg2, ... ,argN</span>

            <span class='special-char'>{</span>
              <span class="gray">...</span>
            <span class='special-char'>}</span>

              <span class='special-char'>(</span>
              <span class='value'>myArgs</span>
              <span class='special-char'>)</span><span class='special-char'>;</span>
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>Let's play with functions! Think about how functions make certain tasks
          easier. They also make our code neater!
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: javascript">
/* Basic function with no return value
   (This is a somewhat contrived example): */
function sayHi(greeting){
  alert(greeting);
}

// Small function with no arguments to flip a coin:
function coinToss(){
  return Math.round(Math.random());
}

/* Our arguments can have whatever type we'd like.
   Notice how here, we loop through whatever array we're
   given and never have to worry about what the name of
   the variable is.

   Take an array of strings, return a sentence: */
function arrayToString(words){
  var sentence = "";

  // Loop through words using nice "for each" shorthand
  for(var i in words){
    if(i < words.length-1)
      sentence += words[i] + " ";
    else
      sentence += words[i] + ".";
  }

  // Return full sentence. This is critical!
  return sentence;
}

/* We can add as many arguments as we'd like.
   This is a rewrite of the Math.pow() function. */
function pow(base, exponent){
  var expValue = base;

  for(var i = 1; i < exponent; i++)
    expValue *= base;

  return expValue;
}
        </pre>
        <div class='student-activity'>
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Grab a partner and check out the given file.</p>
          <p>Fill in the missing function definitions and function calls.
            Remember the difference between the two.
          </p>
          <p><span class='bold gray'>Note:</span> try to finish all four
          functions, but don't feel pressure to do them all.
          If you only get one or two of them, that's totally fine! The most
          important thing is that you just get one done.</p>
        </div>

      <section>
        <h1>Arrays vs. Objects</h1>
        <p>A Javascript <span class='bold gray'>object</span> is the most general
        variable type. Arrays are objects with some special syntax and specific
        methods. There are also many other different types of objects, but we'll 
        just be focusing on the most versatile type.</p>
        <div class='activity'>
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <p>Let's look at a good example of array usage, then contrast that with
            a more messy example. Feel free to follow along on your machines.
          </p>
          <p>The first example just uses a single array of numbers. Pretty simple stuff.</p>
          <p>The second, however, uses two separate arrays that relate to each other and
            are difficult to combine. How would we describe an association between
             these two arrays? Is there a better way?
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>In short, yes! Objects allow us to store data
          <span class='bold gray'>associatively</span>. Instead of being
        limited to numbered indices, we can actually give data names. Even better,
        we can refer to each <span class='bold gray'>property</span> using array
        or dot-syntax.</p>
        <p>Why might we want to use array syntax?</p>
        <p><span class="bold gray">Hint:</span>
        two main reasons, one of which is why we don't put whitespace
        in our directory names.</p>
        <pre class="brush: javascript">
// Store a person object
var person = {
  "age": 23,
  "height": "5'6in",
  "eyeColor": "hazel",
  "alive": true,
  "favoriteColors": ["cyan", "pink", "orange"]
};

// What does this refer to?
// Are they different?
console.log(person.eyeColor);
console.log(person['eyeColor']);

// What about this?
console.log(person.favoriteColors[1]);
        </pre>
        <div class='activity'>
          <h2>Class activity!</h2>
          <p>Let's look at some great usage of objects and how data can be
            organized neatly and succinctly. Notice how each property's name
            matches up with its value instead of just an index with no semantic
            value.
          </p>
          <p>We also use array notation whenever we want to pass a variable to be
            interpreted as an object property. Remember that we can't access a property
            using dot-syntax if it isn't declared as part of the object.</p>
          <p>Open up this file and play with it. Add new properties, modify them, and
            access them.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Grab a partner and look at the given file.</p>
          <p>Then write code below each comment to log the relevant information 
            about the provided <code>car</code> object.</p>
          <p><span class="bold gray">Bonus: </span>If you finish
          early, create a brand new object of your own. Slack out a snippet of
          the code to the class when you are done. Be creative!</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <div class="page-break">
        <h1>Break and review...</h1>
      </div>
      <section>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Using the code from the previous activity as a starting point,
            create a complete application that meets the following specifications:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Users can enter keyboard input (letters).</li>
              <li>Each of the car's methods are assigned to a key.</li>
              <li>When the user presses a key it calls the appropriate function.</li>
              <li>These letters also trigger a global function called <code>reWriteStats()</code>
                that logs the carâ€™s make, model, color, mileage, and <code>isWorking</code>
                status to the console.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><span class="bold gray">Hint:</span> You will need to use the
          <code>document.onkeyup()</code> function to collect input from the
          user's keyboard.

        <h1>Scope and Callbacks</h1>
        <p>Javascript has rules for where variables exist and how they can
          be accessed; this changes depending on where they are defined, 
          if they're nested in brackets, as function arguments, etc.
          Where a variable can be accessed is referred to as its <span class="bold gray">
            scope</span>.</p>
        <p>Scope is a ridiculously important concept in Javascript!</p>
        <h2>The Breakdown</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Variables defined within scripts tags or otherwise outside of all
            other functions/loop bodies/brackets: <span class="bold gray">global variables</span>
          </li>
          <li>Variables defined just within functions/loop bodies/brackets:
            <span class="bold gray">local variables</span>. Visible <span class='italic'>only</span> within the brackets
          </li>
          <li><span class="bold gray">Global variables</span> can be accessed within
          functions as well as outside. Belong to global scope</li>
          <li><span class="bold gray">Local variables</span> disappear after 
          functions return and loops break</li>
        </ul>
        <div class='activity'>
          <h2>Class activity!</h2>
          <p>Let's walk through our file on scope.</p>
          <p>Open up the file on your machine and fill in the missing code and comments.
            We'll go step by step and get your input.
          </p>
          <p>Notice how functions are a variable type and can be stored in variables.</p>
          <p>When we get to <code>.forEach()</code>, we'll be using something called
          <span class='bold gray'>callback functions</span>. It's a way to put the burden
          of doing something on another function, which takes input and
          does what we want instead.</p>
