        <h2>Your feedback re:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Pacing</li>
          <li>Notes availability</li>
          <li>Assignment difficulty</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since this course is so fast-paced and rigorous, focusing on
          the <span class='italic gray bold'>big picture</span> is more important
          than memorizing tiny details. If it's really small and you don't
          remember it, google it! No judgement (seriously!). Taking time
          outside of class to review and practice is &#x1F511;
        </p>
        <p>Your classmates are a valuable resource to you, and you're all here
          for the same reason. Reach out, practice
          together, work together. One team, one dream (&#x1f33D;)
        </p>
        <p><span class='bold'>Protips:</span> if you're staring at a blank screen
          for an hour, reach out for help. Leave adequate time to complete assignments.
          Turn in whatever you've got by the due date. We want to gauge your progress 
          and can't do it without seeing your work.

        <h1>CSS Typography</h1>
        <p><span class='bold gray'>Typography</span> plays an enormous role in
        determining the visual aesthetic and emotional identity of any type-heavy piece.
        It's integral to the look and <span class='italic'>feel</span> of a webpage.</p>
        <p>Some typographic properties:
          <ul>
            <li><span class='bold gray'>Line Height</span>: distance between lines</li>
            <li><span class='bold gray'>Font-Size</span>: size of lettering. Does not
            equate to line height; only size of letters themselves. At least 16px or
            bigger</li>
            <li><span class='bold gray'>Line Length</span>: not a CSS property; should be
            about 50-75 characters per line and minimized for readability</li>
            <li><span class='bold gray'>Letter Spacing</span>: spacing between letters</li>
            <li><span class='bold gray'>Sans-Serif vs Serif</span>: differentiates
            fonts with tails and fonts with no tails</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class='big-serif'>Serif!</h3>
        <h3 class='big-sans-serif'>Sans-serif.</h3>
        <hr class='line-break'>
        <div class='student-activity'><h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Create a block of text and incorporate it into an HTML Document.
          You can use sample text like Lorem Ipsum
          (<a href="https://www.lipsum.com/">https://www.lipsum.com/</a>)
          or Hipsum (<a href="https://hipsum.co/">https://hipsum.co/</a>)
          or anything you like.</p>
          <p>Use CSS styling to modify:
            <ul>
              <li>Font-family</li>
              <li>Font-size</li>
              <li>Font-weight</li>
              <li>Line-height</li>
              <li>Letter-spacing</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr class='line-break'>
        <p>When actually deciding on all of these factors, it's bad practice to 
          choose things randomly as it hurts the consistency and readability of
          your text. This is just an example to get you warmed up.

        <h1>Google Fonts</h1>
        <div class='activity'>
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <p>Let's do a quick overview and demo of Google fonts.</p>
          <p>Google hosts a small library of fonts you can use on the web.
            They're easy to use and, honestly, <span class='italic'>really nice</span>.
            Let's play with some.
          </p>
          <p>Why might it be a good idea to use fonts hosted on the web?
            What do we do if they stop working?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class='student-activity'>
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <p>Create or reuse an HTML document (any will do!) and incorporate 2-3 custom
          Google fonts into the page.
        </p>
        <p><span class='bold'>Bonus</span>: if you finish early, look up Font Awesome
        icons and see if you can figure out how to incorporate one in your page.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Pseudo Styles</h1>
        <p><span class='bold gray'>Pseudo classes</span> are keywords that can be tacked onto
        selectors. They highlight the special states of the selected element. Good
        examples are <code>:hover</code> and <code>:active</code>, which are awesome
        for anchor tags and buttons amongst other things.</p>
        <p>Also includes ways to select children
        of an element (<code>:nth-child()</code>, <code>:only-child</code>) or even
        elements that <span class='italic'>don't</span> match something (<code>:not()</code>).</p>
        <p>There is a pretty long list of pseudo-classes available here:
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes#Index_of_standard_pseudo-classes">
             https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes#Index_of_standard_pseudo-classes
          </a>
        </p>
        <div class='activity'>
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <p>Let's style the various states of a button: normal, hover, focus, active.</p>
          <button>henlo</button>
        </div>
        <p>These pseudo-classes are not limited to form elements and anchor tags, so
          feel free to get creative. Maybe your page header changes colors when
          you hover over it, images get bigger, etc.
        </p>
        <div class='student-activity'>
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Create a series of links and modify the pseudo-classes associated with
            their default, active, hover and focus states.</p>
          <p><span class='bold'>Bonus</span>: if you finish early, incorporate a
          pseudo-class we haven't covered in your page. Then try working with pseudo-elements
          (e.g. <code>::before</code>, <code>::after</code> and try to incorporate
          one or two as well.</p>

        <h1>Bootstrap</h1>
        <div class='student-activity'>
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Let's look at a Bootstrap-powered HTML document together.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Where does this HTML document draw its styles from?</li>
              <li>How does the browser know which HTML element to style and how?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It works similarly to how Google Fonts work.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Let's look at how things are linked and how that relates to the 
          classes we can use, then take a moment to discuss why pre-defined CSS
          is important.
        </p>
        <div class='page-break'></div>
        <h2>Twitter Bootstrap</h2>
        <p>It's a free collection of tools for creating websites and webapps.
          It comes with a pre-built design template for typography, forms,
          navigation, UI elements and JavaScript.
          (Documentation: <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">http://getbootstrap.com</a>)
        </p>
        <p> Bootstrap is good for:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class='bold gray'>UI kit</span>: when you are familiar with the UI features, you can
              copy snippets from your code or the documentation instead of
              creating elements yourself. This can be a time saver.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class='bold gray'>Mobile responsiveness</span>: resizes well based on screen size
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Bootstrap Components</h2>
        <p>Bootstrap contains a wide range of pre-built components that have a
          wide range of applications. Much of beginning development with
          Bootstrap is just testing out components and seeing what will be
          applicable—or just simply what you like!
        </p>
        <p>Let's flip through some of those real quick and see how they're used.</p>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Let's put Bootstrap to work for us.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Navigate to <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">http://getbootstrap.com</a></li>
            <li>Copy the link to the Bootstrap CSS file into one of your
              old HTML files.</li>
            <li>Look through the Bootstrap CSS or Components list and
              incorporate at least three Bootstrap elements onto your page.
            </li>
            <li>Slack a screenshot of your page to the M/W class channel</li>
          </ol>
        <p class='italic'>Hint: first include a link to Bootstrap's CSS. Then visit
          the Bootstrap page on CSS or Components. Get the source first, see
          what your environment is like, then set out to change it.
