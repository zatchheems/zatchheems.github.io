        <ul>
          <li>Administrivia</li>
          <li>Warm-up Activities</li>
          <li>Main Activity</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Administrivia</h1>
        <p>First off: congratulations are in order! You've absorbed an impressive amount
          of full-stack knowledge in an incredibly short amount of time. The majority of the
          front-end technologies used in this course have been completed&mdash;the rest of our
          curriculum focuses mainly on data retrieval/storage as well as several different technologies
          based on JavaScript <span class="gray">(e.g. Node.js, ExpressJS, React, Handlebars, etc.)</span>.
          Later on, we'll go into storing data; right now, we're focusing on getting what we want and 
          making something useful or cool with it!
          </span>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="txt-center">Feeling <span class="burnt">burnt-out?</span></h2>
        <h1 class="txt-center bold">That's okay!</h1>
        <p>The amount of material you've
          absorbed and put to real, practical use is astonishing. Today's class will allow you to
          continue putting your knowledge of JS/AJAX to practical use using useful real-world APIs.
          Much like last time, this class will consist mainly of one large activity and a handful of smaller
          ones.
        </p>
        <h2>Questions, Comments, Concerns?</h2>
        <p>Feel free to ask away! We can use a little bit of time to review anything you're
          not sure of. Otherwise, we have a quick example that you'll be building that uses the New York Times' API
          <a href="https://nytarticle-search-fsf.herokuapp.com/" title="NYT Article Search" target="_blank">
           (https://nytarticle-search-fsf.herokuapp.com/)</a>. Let's search for an article or two.
        </p>
        <p>You'll be building this app today! First, we have a warm-up activity in which we'll be fetching
          photos of cats.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Warm-up Activities</h1>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <h3>Ajax Triggered by Buttons</h3>
          <p>Open up <code>01-cat-button-students.html</code> in <code>12-CatButton</code>, check it out
          in your browser. Try to figure out what it does.</p>
          <p>Then, fill in the missing comments that describe what each section does.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class="line-break">
        <p>Let's go over this activity, going line-by-line.</p>
        <hr class="line-break">
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Partner activity!</h2>
          <p>Grab a partner as I demonstrate an application that triggers AJAX calls with buttons.</p>
          <p>Check out <code>2-button-triggered-ajax-solution.html</code> in <code>13-ButtonTriggeredAJAX</code>.
          Using the sample code you have and the code comments as a guide, recreate the functionality you observed.</p>
          <p>Your final application should trigger gifs about your celebrity/author to appear.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class="line-break">
        <p>This is another one of those activities which is actually simpler than you might think.
          As we go over this, pay special attention to the data attribute "person"&mdash;this is
          <span title="key!">&#x1F511;</span>.

          <h2>Partner activity!</h2>
          <h3>Creating Elements Dynamically</h3>
          <p>Another partner activity coming your way!</p>
          <p>Let's build something that creates elements dynamically using JSON objects. I'll demo it first.</p>
          <p>Check out <code>3-dynamic-elements-students.html</code> in <code>14-DynamicElements</code>.
          Use the comments in the code as a guide to replicate the functionality shown to you.</p>
          <p>Your completed application should trigger gifs to appear related to the animal making the sound
            listed in the button.
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr class="line-break">
        <p>What do we have to do with the JSON objects Giphy returns? What do we create for each?</p>
        <hr class="line-break">
        <h1>Quick Reiteration...</h1>
        <p>Let's review:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What does API stand for?</li>
          <li>What are APIs?</li>
          <li>What are three use-cases for APIs?</li>
          <li>What does JSON stand for?</li>
          <li>Why is JSON useful?</li>
          <li>How have we been retrieving our data from online sources?</li>
          <li>Are these requests synchronous or asynchronous? Why?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="bold">Questions? Anything unclear?</span> Could you give these answers in a job interview?
          (Yes, you will likely be asked about APIs and making requests!)

        <h2>Back to our last partner activity of the day before the NYT activity!</h2>
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Partner activity!</h2>
        <h3>Pausing Gifs</h3>
        <p>Here's the last partner activity of the day. It's an application that can start and pause the 
          animation of clicked gifs.
        </p>
        <p>Open up
          <code>4-pausing-gifs-students.html</code> in
          <code>15-PausingGifs</code>.</p>
        <p>Using the comments provided in the code, add in the code necessary to provide
          stop/start animation to your application.</p>
      </div>
      <hr class="line-break">
      <p>Let's review this activity. Again, notice the pivotal role a <code>data</code> attribute plays.</p>
      <hr class="line-break">
      <p>Right before we take our break, let's break into groups of four for the remainder of the class.
        You'll be building the NYT application together! Be sure to sign up for an NYT API key via
        <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/signup" target="_blank"> https://developer.nytimes.com/signup</a>.

        <h1>NYT Article Search Application</h1>
        <p>As a refresher, let's revisit the <a href="https://nytarticle-search-fsf.herokuapp.com/" title="NYT Article Search" target="_blank">
          New York Times Article Search Application</a> (kind of a mouthful, it'll continue to be 
          NYT from here on out).</p>
        <p>Remember that the most important functionality is that it allows you to search their
          article API&mdash;<a href="http://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json" target="_blank">here's</a> that API in action.
        </p>
        <p>Also remember: this is a <span class="note">hard</span> activity to do completely right.
        It requires you to code quickly, efficiently divide tasks, and deal with bugs. It's also great
        for gaining mastery over these topics.</p>
        <p>You should be partnering in sub-pairs, where one pair does UI and the other does API calls.
          Take honest stock of your abilities and focus on what you're comfortable doing.
        </p>
        <h2>Why this specific format?</h2>
        <p>A specific developer (or team of developers) is often designated to work on a specific feature. When working as separate
        teams, developers need to learn to communicate needs and expectations with other devs working on related features (i.e. data
        teams should expect text inputs from the UI team).</p>

        <p>It should have shown you three main things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>APIs are harder to use than you might expect</li>
          <li>Working in separate teams requires careful coordination</li>
