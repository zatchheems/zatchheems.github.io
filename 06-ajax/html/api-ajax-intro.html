        <h1>Parsing Objects</h1>
        <p>A saturday class for a new unit! Exciting stuff.</p>
        <p>Today, we'll be starting with a warm-up activity.</p>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>We'll be beginning today with an activity to practice using JS objects. Open up
             <code>1-customer-object.html</code> in <code>01-CustomerObject</code>.
          </p>
          <p>Using the instructions shown in the comments, write <code>console.log</code> statements
            that parse out the requested information.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class="line-break">
        <h2>JSON</h2>
        <p>What is <span class="note">JSON</span>? Using JavaScript Object Notation, or
          <abbr title='JavaScript Object Notation'>JSON</abbr>, is a convenient way to package data in
          a format that is easy to read and parse, even between different languages, servers, etc.
          We will be using a ton of JSON to get data from here on out.</p>
          <div class="activity">
            <h2>Instructor demo...</h2>
            <p>Let's take a look at a site that scrapes data from an API, and what that looks like.</p>
            <p>We'll be going to
              <a href="http://nyt-mongo-scraper.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">http://nyt-mongo-scraper.herokuapp.com/</a> to see how
            it functions. Check out this site to get a feel for how it functions. Pay attention to the buttons that
            retrive new articles and load them onto the page in real time.</p>
            <p>Next. let's check out
              <a href="http://nyt-mongo-scraper.herokuapp.com/api/headlines" target="_blank">http://nyt-mongo-scraper.herokuapp.com/api/headlines</a>.
              When we do this, we'll be taking a look under the hoot at the application as it stores
              each headline as an entry in a JavaScript Object. Just like with the CustomerObject
            example, this object holds a mix of various data types to store information such as the article's id, headline,
            summary, date, and whether it is saved or not.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>This method of storing data as JavaScript objects is a common practice; you will see this
            again and again. Feel free to take another look at the app and ask any questions you may have.
          </p>
          <p>Otherwise... it's activity time!</p>
          <div class="student-activity">
            <h2>Student activity!</h2>
            <p>For the next few moments, research amongst yourselves the answers to the following questions:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>What is an API?</li>
              <li>What does API stand for?</li>
              <li>What are some examples of APIs? (Find links to specific APIs)</li>
              <li>What do these specific APIs allow you as a developer to do?</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <hr class="line-break">
          <h2>API Overview</h2>
          <p>Let's get some answers to the above questions. What did you find?</p>
          <hr class="line-break">
          <h2>What is an <span class='italic'>API?</span></h2>
          <p>API stands for Application Programming Interface. They provide a way for creating user code
            that utilizes other pre-built code to do various tasks. It can be used to quickly retrieve
            data from another person's database, to utilize someone elses more complex functionality (like maps),
              or to control other hardware and software.</p>
          <p>What are some examples?</p>
          <p>APIs commonly use JSON to return our data to us in a nice, neat package. It's a great format that
            even many non-JavaScript languages&mdash;e.g. PHP, Python and Ruby&mdash;support.
          </p>
          <div class="activity">
            <h2>Instructor demo...</h2>
            <p>Let's take a look at <a href="https://market.mashape.com/ismaelc/yoda-speak" target="_blank">https://market.mashape.com/ismaelc/yoda-speak</a>.
             The Yoda API takes a string sentence and then outputs a revised sentence.</p>
            <p>Then, let's check out this URL: <a href="http://www.faceplusplus.com/demo-detect/" target="_blank">http://www.faceplusplus.com/demo-detect/</a>).
            Let's grab a photo of someone in the class who wears glasses via LinkedIn or something and paste
            the image URL into the application. The response JSON is intended to analyze "sentiment"
            based on the image. Values closer to 100 indicate greater likelihood.</p>

          <div class="student-activity">
            <h2>Student activity!</h2>
            <h3>API Experimentation</h3>
            <p>Using the <a href="https://market.mashape.com/explore" target="_blank">Mashape API library</a> as a starting point experiment with a few APIs of your
            own.</p>
            <p><span class="note">Note:</span> You will need to create an account on Mashape first.</p>
            <p><span class="note">Note:</span> Not all of the APIs are easy to use, just keep experimenting!</p>
          </div>
          <div class="activity">
            <h2>Instructor demo...</h2>
            <p>So if all this data exists in the world and we have JSON being created, how do we access
            the data?</p>
            <p>Let's take a look at the <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">OMDb API</a>. 
              This API provides a database of information on nearly every movie in existence.
             As we scroll through the basic documentation, we'll notice that in this API, we "build" URLs
            that point to JSON objects associated with various movies. The parameters allow us to filter results.</p>
           <p>Unfortunately, the OMDb API is no longer a free API and requires an API key.
             Fortunately, we have a key! All we have to do is tack on the key to the URL like so:
             <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=Space+Jam&apikey=________">http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=Space+Jam&apikey=<i class="redacted"></i></a></p>
          </div>
          <div class="student-activity">
            <h2>Student activity!</h2>
            <p>In pairs, take a look at the OMDb API yourself.</p>
            <p>Without using the UI, how would I get the information for any specific movie?</p>
            <p></p>
          </div>

        <h1>Using JavaScript With APIs</h1>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor Demo</h2>
          <h3>OMDb API Without The Browser</h3>
          <p>So, how do we get the data we want without using our browser whatsoever?</p>
          <p>Let's do it with our favorite language and via its simpler framework.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Using AJAX Calls</h2>
        <pre class="brush: javascript">
// The jQuery Way:
$.ajax({
  url: "example.url/", // What do we want to get?
  method: "GET" // or "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"...
}).then(response => {
  // Do something with our data if everything went well!
}).;

// The ES6 way:
fetch("example.url/", {
  method: "GET",
}).then(response => {
  // do a thing with our data
}).catch(error => console.log);
/* We catch errors in case our fetch doesn't work
   and our promise is broken.*/

        </pre>
        <h2>What Even <span class="italic">Is</span> AJAX?</h2>
        <p>Why do we need the <code>.then</code> function? This is known in ES6 as a promise.
        Why do we want to promise stuff? What does AJAX even stand for?</p>
        <p>To answer these questions, we have to discuss JavaScript's ability to run things
          asynchronously. We've already seen some asynchronous behavior with timeouts and intervals.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, <abbr title="Asynchronous JavaScript And XML">AJAX</abbr> stands for
          <span class="note">Asynchronous JavaScript And XML</span>. Any questions on this?</p>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Check out <code>3-ajax-to-html.html</code> in <code>03-AJAX_to_HTML</code>.
          Use this file as a starting point to fill in the table.</p>
          <p>This is your turn to play with AJAX! Using the example AJAX code given to you,
            create an AJAX call to the OMDb API of your own. Then, try
          logging any property about the movie to your console.</p>
          <p><span class="note">Hint</span> you will need multiple AJAX Calls.</p>
          <p><span class="note">Bonus</span> once you've completed the basic activity,
            refactor your solution to be more <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr>
            by placing repetitive logic inside of functions to be called when needed.</p>

            <a href="https://developers.giphy.com/docs/">(https://developers.giphy.com/docs/)</a>,
              try to research answers to the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>How would you return back a single gif tied to a search term?</li>
              <li>How would you return five gifs tied to a search term?</li>
