        <h1>Administrivia</h1>
        <p>Welcome back to project week!</p>
        <p>Today, we'll be reviewing the GitHub workflow and learning some
          project management concepts and tools.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Git Recap</h1>
        <p>We're going to take some time to review the collaborative git/GitHub workflow.</p>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <p>Follow along as I make changes to my notes to correct a terrible typo.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Partner activity!</h2>
          <p>Refer to the accompanying PDF for help if needed.</p>
          <p>One partner should create a new repository on GitHub.
            Name it anything you like. Don't forget to click <span class="gray">"initialize this repository with a README"</span>.</p>
<p>Add the other partner as a collaborator, by going to "Settings > Collaborators" and adding their email address.</p>
<p>Under the "Branches" tab in settings, choose master from the drop down under "Branch protection rules" </p>
<p>Check all of the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Protect this branch</li>
  <li>Require pull request reviews before merging</li>
  <li>Include administrators</li>
</ul>
<p>Clone the repository to your local machine using <code>git clone</code> followed by your repository url.</p>
<p>Create and checkout a new branch using <code>git checkout -b</code> followed by a branch name. Remember that branch names should describe the feature that will be created on that branch.</p>
<p>Open the project in your editor and make some changes. </p>
<p>Add and commit the changes using:</p>
<pre class="brush: shell">
git add -A
git commit -m "descriptive message here"</pre>
<p>Push these changes back up to GitHub using <code>git push origin</code> followed by your branch name.</p>
<p>Navigate to your repository in GitHub and there will be a prompt to open a pull request (you may need to refresh).</p>
<p>Click the green button to "create a pull request"</p>
<p>Assign a collaborator to review your pull request and merge it.</p>
<p>On your local machine, checkout the master branch using <code>git checkout master</code> and then update the branch to show the latest changes using 'git pull'</p>
<p>New branches should be made off of the updated master branch.</p>

        <h1>MVP</h1>
        <p><acronym title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</acronym> stands for Minimum Viable Product. Defining an MVP for an application helps to get the application up and going quickly
        and avoid scope creep. It's a vital step in creating projects or prototypes rapidly.</p>
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Start with a general idea.</li>
          <li>Identify the target audience.</li>
          <li>Identify the problem that the product will address.</li>
          <li>Write down the primary goal of the product.</li>
          <li>Identify and prioritize essential user stories.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>What are user stories?</p>
        <p><span class="note">User stories</span> help us identify exactly how we expect something to function from the
        user's perspective. We can pinpoint exactly they want and why, effectively divorcing our expectations as developers from the
        product. They help to keep focus on adding value to the <span class="italic">user</span> during the project build and ensure
        that each feature built is inline with the primary goal of the product.</p>
        <p>They always looks like this:</p>
        <blockquote>As a ______, I want ______ so that I can ______.</blockquote>
        <p>One of the advantages of thinking in this way is avoiding cramming our product with extraneous
          functionality, "would-be-nice"-s, and other fluff that is super nice, but not necessary.
          You just want enough you can show to investors, demo for customers, etc. Functionality first; fluff
          comes later.
        </p>
        <p>You can think of the minimum viable product as the minimum <span class="italic">demoable</span> product.</p>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Group activity!</h2>
          <p> With your group, answer each of the following questions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Who is your target audience?</li>
            <li>What is the problem that the product will address?</li>
            <li>What is the primary goal of the product?</li>
            <li>Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer).</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Remember, your MVP should be the absolute <span class="bold">minimum</span>
            product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.</p>
          <p>As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>As a user, I want to post pictures so that I can share my life.</li>
            <li>As a user, I want to be able to search for other users so that I can find their list of images.</li>
            <li>As a user, I want to be able to view other people's images so that I can keep up with what's happening in their lives.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories,
            etc. are cool, but they aren't essential. They should <span class="bold">not</span> be part of the MVP.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Issues</h1>
        <p>Let's talk about GitHub issues.</p>
        <p>GitHub issues is a feature that lets you identify bugs and problems within a project
          and assign them to yourself or collaborators.
        </p>
        <p>Before we can open issues, we need to break our user stories into tasks. Each task should be clear, concise, and something
        that each teammate understands how to implement. Let's show the basic idea of adding an issue to a project, and also use some
        markdown to create a checklist.</p>
        <h3>Markdown template:</h3>
        <pre class="brush: shell">
## User Story
As a ______, I want ______ so that I can ______.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Item 1 of user story...
- [ ] Item 2 of user story...
- [ ] (...)
- [ ] Item n of user story....
</pre>
        <hr>
        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>The user story is added to help maintain focus and insure that each issue is linked to one of the MVP user stories.</p>
        <p>Acceptance criteria outlines are what must be accomplished before the issue is closed. Acceptance criteria tells both the developer
        and the reviewer what is expected for this feature. These should be as fine-grained as possible.</p>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Group activity!</h2>
          <p>You'll be creating issues now!</p>
          <p>Start by listing the tasks involved in completing each of your user stories.</p>
          <p>Once you have 1-5 tasks written up for each user story, open a GitHub issue for each task by clicking on "Issues" and the
          green "New Issue" button. Use the template below, replacing the user stories and acceptance criteria with your own.</p>
          <pre class="brush: shell">
## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to input search queries so that
I can search Stack Overflow when I'm stuck.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] index.html has a text input
- [ ] index.html has a search button

          </pre>
          
          <p>As an example: In a dating website application...</p>
          <p><span class="bold">User Story:</span> As a user I want to see my closest match, so that I can
          meet someone with whom I share interests.<p>
          <p class="bold id">&#x274C; Bad task:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>On new member form submit, find and display best match.</li>
            </ol>
          <p class="bold class">&#x2705; Good tasks:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Build a form that captures user scores (1-5) to ten questions.</li>
            <li>On submit, save the ten numerical answers to as an array.</li>
            <li>Compare the user array to each existing user array and find the closest match.</li>
            <li>Display the closest match to the user.</li>

        <h1>Kanban</h1>
        <p>It's important to have a management system in place when you tackle a project. For a project of this scope,
          a Kanban board makes a lot of sense. Kanban boards give us a birds eye view of the tasks we've completed,
          are working on, and need to do. It's
          a simple, visual, drag and drop scheduling system. GitHub has several built-in options for organizing projects. In this case,
          we will be using GitHub Projects.
        </p>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <p>Follow along as I step through a project in GitHub projects.</p>

        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Use the "Projects" tab in GitHub to create a new project (use the automated kanban template).</p>
          <p>Add a new column called
          Icebox (You will need to exit the "add card" pop-up to access the "add column" area on the right side).</p>
          <p>Click "+ Add Cards"
          and dragging each issue into the correct column, To Do or Icebox.</p>
          <p><span class="note">Bonus:</span> if you have extra time, let each team member add some additional features to the Icebox. This is a great place to hold future
          enhancement ideas. Remember that each feature may need to be broken down into smaller tasks in the future before you open
          issues and start building them.</p>

        <h1>Assigning Issues and Stand-up</h1>
        <p>This platform allows us to assign ourselves issues to work on or other collaborators within the group. This helps the team
          divide up responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>Nowadays, it's almost impossible to avoid seeing <span class="note">stand-ups</span> within project management.
        A stand-up is a meeting typically no longer than 10 minutes wherein each member of the team talks about what they worked on last
        time, what they intend on accomplishing that day and any obstacles blocking their progress.</p>
        <p>They're called stand-ups because everyone is literally standing up, a 
        conscious reminder that the meeting should be quick and concise. Most companies use daily stand-up meetings.</p>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Group activity!</h2>
          <p>Before your first stand-up, each member of the team should go through the To Do column of the Project Board and self-assign
          at least one issue.</p>
          <p>To do this, click on the issue and on the right choose "self-assign".</p>
          <p>Everyone should have a clear idea of what they intend to accomplish today. Now it's time for your first stand-up!</p>
          <p>Stand if you are able, such that your meeting is short and to the point.</p>
          <p>Each member of the team should
          say what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and what, if anything, is blocking their progress.</p>
          <p>Stand-ups should
          be held <span class="italic">daily</span> from this point forward—even days that we don't have class (use Slack).</p>
