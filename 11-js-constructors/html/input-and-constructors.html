      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Welcome back, everyone! Today's class will be about being totally proficient with constructors as well as the basics of
        recursion. We'll be going over that last topic in detail, but will be skipping the mathematical computer science behind it.
        Instead, we'll be focusing on its applications with regards to objects and data manipulation. We'll also be focusing on your ability
        to user constructor functions to link two different objects together.
      </p>
      <p>First, a couple of notes on the portfolio assignment and the pace of the homework.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Now, let's do a warm-up exercise before diving into the new material.</p>

        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>Constructing Programmers</h3>
        <p>In this activity, we are going to create a constructor function called <span class="monospace accent">Programmer</span> which can be used to create objects containing
        information on various programmers.</p>
        <p>Your <span class="monospace accent">Programmer</span> constructor should be able to take in the following information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The programmer's name</li>
          <li>Their position/job title</li>
          <li>How old they are</li>
          <li>Favorite programming language</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, create a method for the constructor that would print all of the information contained within an object to the console.</p>
        <p>Finally, create a <span class="monospace accent">Programmer</span> object and call the method to print its contents.</p>

        <h2>Constructing Programmers Review</h2>
        <p>Let's go over the code for this activity.</p>
        <p>Notice that the process of creating a new <span class="monospace accent">Programmer</span> object might get tiresome, since we constantly
        have to modify our code each time.</p>

      <h1>User Input and Constructors</h1>
      <p>Reminding ourselves about the <code>inquirer</code> package will be useful for the sake of reducing rewritten code on our part&mdash;plus,
      the package itself is fairly simple to use while providing users with an elegant, verbose, and robust solution for providing input. We can use
      this input to create objects using constructors.</p>
      <div class="activity">
        <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
        <p>Let's go over an alternate version of the "Programmers" assignment with a prompt. We'll step through the code shortly.
        </p>
        <p>As a small refresher, what do I have to do before using the <code>inquirer</code> package?</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="activity">
        <h2>Class activity!</h2>
        <p>Try playing with the code in <code>06-ProgrammersWithPrompt</code> to create multiple objects.</p>
        <p>When you use a loop to accomplish this, what happens?</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Next, let's look at a file that uses a loop to try to achieve the correct functionality. What do you think gets printed to the console?</p>
        <p>Soon, we'll demo it and see. Something might seem off...</p>
      </div>
      <p>That <code>for</code> loop is messing everything up! It happens that multiple <code>inquirer</code> instances are being created all at once,
      creating five identical <span class="monospace accent">Programmer</span> objects. How about we learn a way to deal with this problem?</p>
      <div class="activity">
        <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
        <p>Let's look at a working solution that doesn't use a loop. What's going on here?</p>
        <p>How are the objects stored?</p>
        <hr>
        <p>It's not quite finished yet, as the objects are only obtainable via the function and not afterwards. It looks like we'll need an array we can
          store them in. Good thing we have a solution that solves this!

      <h1>Recursion</h1>
      <p>Recursion is an interesting concept in computer science, based heavily on mathematical computer science proofs. Generally speaking,
        they consist of functions with a <span class="note">base case</span>, or a condition in which the function should return. Otherwise,
        the function calls itself, most often with an argument it repeatedly edits.</p>
      <p>A classic example of a recursive function is one that returns the factorial of a number:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-JavaScript">// Declare a recursive function to print out
//  the factorial of a number
var factorial = (num) => {
  if(num <= 1)
    return 1;
  return num * factorial(num-1);
}</code></pre>
      <p>It may help to draw this out, so after I demo it I'll draw the different stack frames as we recurse through, then "unravel", as it were.</p>
      <p>Let's get some questions on this before putting it to work.</p>
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>Team Manager: Part I</h3>
        <p>This activity is pretty large, so we will be working on Part I before the break and Part II after.</p>
        <p>Over the course of this assignment you are going to put together a function which uses constructors and user input to create
        and manage a team of players.</p>
        <p>Start out by creating a constructor function called <code>Player</code> with the following properties and methods:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="monospace accent">name</span>: player name</li>
          <li><span class="monospace accent">position</span>: player's position</li>
          <li><span class="monospace accent">offense</span>: value between 1 and 10 corresponding to skill on offense</li>
          <li><span class="monospace accent">defense</span>: value between 1 and 10 corresponding to skill on defense</li>
          <li><code>goodGame</code>: increase either the player's offense or defense property based upon a coinflip</li>
          <li><code>badGame</code>: decrease either the player's offense or defense property based upon a coinflip</li>
          <li><code>printStats</code>: print all of the player's properties to the screen</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, create a program which allows the user to create 3 unique players; 2 starters and a sub. It should take as user input
        the name, position, offense, and defense of each player.</p>
        <p>Once all of the players have been created, print their stats.</p>
        <p><span class="hint">Hint:</span> Remember to use recursion when looping with inquirer! Otherwise, your program might not return the prompts as you expect.</p>

      <h1>Team Manager, Continued</h1>
      <p>Let's do a quick summary of the code in Part I of the Team Manager activity. It prints players' stats to the screen and not too much else,
      but should give you a good idea of how to better create and use constructor functions with inquirer. After we're done, you'll go on
      to complete Part II of this activity.</p>
      <hr>
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>Team Manager: Part II</h3>
        <p>Once your code is functioning properly, move on to create a function called <code>playGame</code> which will be run after all of the
        players have been created and will function as follows.</p>
        <p>Run 5 times. Each time the function runs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Two random numbers between 1 and 20 are rolled and compared against the starters' offensive and defensive stats:
          <ul>
            <li>If the first number is lower than the sum of the team's offensive stat, add one point to the team's score.</li>
            <li>If the second number is higher than the sum of the team's defensive stat, remove one point from the team's score.</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>After the score has been changed, prompt the user to allow them to substitute a player from within the starters array with
          the player from within the subs array.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After the game has finished (been run 5 times):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the score is positive, run <span class="mono accent">goodGame</span> for all of the players currently within the starters array.</li>
          <li>If the score is negative, run <span class="mono accent">badGame</span> for all of the players currently within the starters array.</li>
          <li>If the score is equal to zero, do nothing with the starters.</li>
          <li>Give the user a message about if they won, and the status of their starters.</li>
          <li>After printing the results, ask the user if they would like to play again:
          <ul>
            <li>Run <code>playGame</code> from the start once more if they do.</li>
            <li>End the program if they don't.</li>
          </ul></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Team Manager: Part II Summary</h2>
        <p>Let's look at the code for this activity and walk through it. Don't worry if you go the first part but struggled with the rest&mdash;so
          long as you got the first part and can follow along as the code is shown to you, you're in good shape.

      <h1>Nested Constructors</h1>
      <p>So far we have held our constructed objects within arrays to great affect, but what if we wanted to call upon those constructed
      objects within another object? What would we do then? Well, as it turns out, we can actually nest a constructor within another constructor fairly easily. In fact, it operates
      very similarly to creating a method within a constructor.</p>
      <div class="activity">
        <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
        <p>Let's look at an application that exports a constructor function from one file and uses it within another. We'll also take
          take a look at the unique ability to add objects created from one constructor into into an array created by another.
        </p>
        <p>It uses a few different files; we'll check out all of them.</p>

      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <p>In this activity we are going to make two constructors in two different files in which one constructor calls upon the other
        within it.</p>
        <p>The first constructor function is called "Student" and has the following properties within it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="monospace accent">name</span></li>
          <li><span class="monospace accent">favoriteSubject</span></li>
          <li><span class="monospace accent">gpa</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The second constructor function is called "Class" and has the following properties within it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An array of students within the class</li>
          <li>Number of students in the class</li>
          <li>Name of the professor</li>
          <li>Room number</li>
          <li>The Student constructor function from above which adds a new student to the class</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="bonus">Bonus:</span> Make it so that that your application can take in user input to add new classes
          and new students to those classes.</p>
