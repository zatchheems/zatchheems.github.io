      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Welcome back, everyone! Today's class will be about being totally proficient with constructors as well as the basics of
        recursion. We'll be going over that last topic in detail, but will be skipping the mathematical computer science behind it.
        Instead, we'll be focusing on its applications with regards to objects and data manipulation. We'll also be focusing on your ability
        to user constructor functions to link two different objects together.
      </p>
      <p>First, a couple of notes on the portfolio assignment and the pace of the homework.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Now, let's do a warm-up exercise before diving into the new material.</p>

      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>Constructing Programmers</h3>
        <p>In this activity, we are going to create a constructor function called <span class="monospace accent">Programmer</span> which can be used to create objects containing
        information on various programmers.</p>
        <p>Your <span class="monospace accent">Programmer</span> constructor should be able to take in the following information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The programmer's name</li>
          <li>Their position/job title</li>
          <li>How old they are</li>
          <li>Favorite programming language</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, create a method for the constructor that would print all of the information contained within an object to the console.</p>
        <p>Finally, create a <span class="monospace accent">Programmer</span> object and call the method to print its contents.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="review">
        <h2>Constructing Programmers Review</h2>
        <p>Let's go over the code for this activity.</p>
        <p>Notice that the process of creating a new <span class="monospace accent">Programmer</span> object might get tiresome, since we constantly
        have to modify our code each time.</p>

      <h1>User Input and Constructors</h1>
      <p>Reminding ourselves about the <code>inquirer</code> package will be useful for the sake of reducing rewritten code on our part&mdash;plus,
      the package itself is fairly simple to use while providing users with an elegant, verbose, and robust solution for providing input. We can use
      this input to create objects using constructors.</p>
      <div class="activity">
        <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
        <p>Let's go over an alternate version of the "Programmers" assignment with a prompt. We'll step through the code shortly.
        </p>
        <p>As a small refresher, what do I have to do before using the <code>inquirer</code> package?</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="activity">
        <h2>Class activity!</h2>
        <p>Try playing with the code in <code>06-ProgrammersWithPrompt</code> to create multiple objects.</p>
        <p>When you use a loop to accomplish this, what happens?</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Next, let's look at a file that uses a loop to try to achieve the correct functionality. What do you think gets printed to the console?</p>
        <p>Soon, we'll demo it and see. Something might seem off...</p>
      </div>
      <p>That <code>for</code> loop is messing everything up! It happens that multiple <code>inquirer</code> instances are being created all at once,
      creating five identical <span class="monospace accent">Programmer</span> objects. How about we learn a way to deal with this problem?</p>
      <div class="activity">
        <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
        <p>Let's look at a working solution that doesn't use a loop. What's going on here?</p>
        <p>How are the objects stored?</p>
        <hr>
        <p>It's not quite finished yet, as the objects are only obtainable via the function and not afterwards. It looks like we'll need an array we can
          store them in. Good thing we have a solution that solves this!
        </p>

      <h1>Recursion</h1>
      <p>Recursion is an interesting concept in computer science, based heavily on mathematical computer science proofs. Generally speaking,
        they consist of functions with a <span class="note">base case</span>, or a condition in which the function should return. Otherwise,
        the function calls itself, most often with an argument it repeatedly edits.</p>
      <p>A classic example of a recursive function is one that returns the factorial of a number:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-JavaScript">// Declare a recursive function to print out
//  the factorial of a number
var factorial = (num) => {
  if(num <= 1)
    return 1;
  return num * factorial(num-1);
}</code></pre>
      <p>It may help to draw this out, so after I demo it I'll draw the different stack frames as we recurse through, then "unravel", as it were.</p>
      <p>Let's get some questions on this before putting it to work.</p>
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>Team Manager: Part I</h3>
        <p>This activity is pretty large, so we will be working on Part I before the break and Part II after.</p>
        <p>Over the course of this assignment you are going to put together a function which uses constructors and user input to create
        and manage a team of players.</p>
        <p>Start out by creating a constructor function called <code>Player</code> with the following properties and methods:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="monospace accent">name</span>: player name</li>
          <li><span class="monospace accent">position</span>: player's position</li>
          <li><span class="monospace accent">offense</span>: value between 1 and 10 corresponding to skill on offense</li>
          <li><span class="monospace accent">defense</span>: value between 1 and 10 corresponding to skill on defense</li>
          <li><code>goodGame</code>: increase either the player's offense or defense property based upon a coinflip</li>
          <li><code>badGame</code>: decrease either the player's offense or defense property based upon a coinflip</li>
          <li><code>printStats</code>: print all of the player's properties to the screen</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, create a program which allows the user to create 3 unique players; 2 starters and a sub. It should take as user input
        the name, position, offense, and defense of each player.</p>
        <p>Once all of the players have been created, print their stats.</p>
        <p><span class="hint">Hint:</span> Remember to use recursion when looping with inquirer! Otherwise your program might not return the prompts as you expect.</p>
