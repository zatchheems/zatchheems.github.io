      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to another new unit! We'll be putting the brakes on NPM for now, working in Node to
        master your understanding of JavaScript objects. During today's class, we'll be focusing on making your knowledge of objects
        much more robust such that you can use them creatively and efficiently.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Practice With Objects</h1>
      <p>Objects are powerful, flexible, and beautifully efficient data structures capable of extensive functionality while offering
      the ability to minimize repeated code, much like functions. They are the crux of modern JavaScript development: structures with self-contained
        bundles of functions and data that stay succinct and organized. In Node, the special object
        <code>module.exports</code> allows us to use prewritten code. Let's focus just on the objects themselves for now.
      </p>
      <h2>Syntax Refresher</h2>
      <p>Recall that objects can have any data type as a child element, stored as a key-value pair&mdash;ints,
        floats, strings, arrays, functions, other objects, etc. Here's a quick reminder
        of what that might look like with multiple different types:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-JavaScript">// Assuming we installed Moment.js
const moment = require("moment");

var person = {
  name: "Dr. Thaddeus Venture",
  birthday: new moment("4/30/1960","MM/DD/YYYY"),
  occupation: "Super scientist",
  family: ["Hank Venture", "Dean Venture"],
  getAge: function(){
    return moment().diff(this.birthday, "years");
  }
};

// Output current age based on stored birthday
console.log(person.getAge());</code></pre>
      <p>Let's do a quick activity to refresh your skills with creating objects.
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>Raining Cats and Dogs</h3>
        <p>Make a dogs object with three keys:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First key called "raining" with a value of <code>true</code></li>
          <li>Second key called "noise" with a value of "Woof!"</li>
          <li>Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which logs the noise to the screen if it is raining dogs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then, make a cats object with three keys:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First key called "raining" with a value of <code>false</code></li>
          <li>Second key called "noise" with a value of "Meow!"</li>
          <li>Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which logs the noise to the screen if it is raining cats</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Make the dog bark, and make the cat meow.</p>
        <p><span class="bonus">Bonus:</span> Create a function called "massHysteria" which takes in both the cats and the dogs object and prints <span class="italic mid-accent">"DOGS AND CATS LIVING
        TOGETHER! MASS HYSTERIA!"</span> if both of the <code>raining</code> keys are equal to true.</p>
        <p>The focus of this activity is to maintain as much simplicity as possible. After building the required objects, refactor your
          code until it is as simple as you can make it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="review">
        <h2>Raining Cats and Dogs Live-coding</h2>
        <p>Let's get a couple of people to code out different parts of the assignment, explaining
          logic along the way.
        </p>
        <p>As we complete the code, do you see anything that seems redundant?
          Are there foolproof ways to get rid of this redundancy?
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Intro to Constructors</h1>
      <p>An easy way to think about a <span class="note">constructor</span> is a template function that creates
        objects with a particular layout. Instead of what we saw earlier with identically-structured
        objects, we can create a constructor that literally <span class="italic">constructs</span>
        an object in that format. Let's reduce the redundancy in that previous example after going
        over the basic syntax.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Common convention is to capitalize
//  Constructors--plus camelCase, do CamelCase.
// This helps us distinguish functions from Constructors
function TestObj(a, b){
  // use "this" to set the object's own parameters to the given arguments
  this.a = a;
  this.b = b;
  this.c = "foo"; // default value for all returned objects
}

var foo = new TestObj("42","ham"),
    bar = new TestObj("23","spam"),
    baz = new TestObj("4533","eggs");

console.log(foo.a === bar.a); // false
console.log(bar.c === baz.c); // true
</code></pre>
      <p>To make something abundantly clear: <span class="mid-accent bold">never,
        <span class="italic">ever</span> call the constructor function on its own.</span> It
        will override all the variables of every instance of the object "template" by bringing
        those variables into the global scope. Remember what <code>this</code> refers to outside of functions:
        the window in the browser, and on the back-end a set of Node globals including the process and console.</p>
      <p>Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's go over using a constructor with the <code>person</code> object we saw earlier.
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Define a new constructor for a Person object
function Person(name, birthday, family){
  this.name = name;
  this.birthday = new moment(birthday, "MM/DD/YYYY");
  this.occupation = occupation;
  this.family = family;
  this.getAge = function(){
    return moment().diff(this.birthday, "years");
  }
}

var doc = new Person(
  "Dr. Thaddeus Venture",
  "4/30/1960",
  "Super scientist",
  ["Hank Venture", "Dean Venture"]);
</code></pre>
      <p>This code doesn't look particularly exciting, but it's demonstrably more efficient when we want multiple
        objects with the same structure. If I wanted to add a new <code>Person</code> like in the code above,
        what would I do without a constructor? It would be extremely redundant, even more so if I wanted to add more.
        That, or I'd have to use prototypes. More on that later.
      </p>
      <p>Let's look at an updated "Raining Cats and Dogs" version.</p>
      <div class="activity">
        <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
        <p>We already know the basic functionality, so let's just go through the code
          and see what changed. The resulting code should be visibly more concise.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Questions, comments before you dive into a new activity?</h2>
      <hr>
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>Character Creation</h3>
        <p>Over the course of this activity you are going to be using constructors to create simplistic
          characters for use within a very basic Roleplaying Game (RPG)</p>
        <p>Each character created using your constructor should have the following properties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="note">Name:</span> The character's name <span class="mid-accent">&LongRightArrow;</span> String</li>
          <li><span class="note">Profession:</span> What the character does for a living <span class="mid-accent">&LongRightArrow;</span> String</li>
          <li><span class="note">Gender:</span> The character's gender <span class="mid-accent">&LongRightArrow;</span> String</li>
          <li><span class="note">Age:</span> The character's age <span class="mid-accent">&LongRightArrow;</span> Integer</li>
          <li><span class="note">Strength:</span> Abstraction for how strong the character is <span class="mid-accent">&LongRightArrow;</span> Integer</li>
          <li><span class="note">HitPoints (HP):</span> abstraction for how much health the character has <span class="mid-accent">&LongRightArrow;</span> Integer</li>
          <li><span class="note">PrintStats:</span> Function which prints all of a character's properties to the screen</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have created your constructor, create two new characters and print their properties to the screen.</p>
        <p>Fool around and get comfortable with your constructor before moving onto the next parts of the activity</p>
        Once comfortable with your constructor, it is time to start making this character creation system a little
        more reactive by adding in some more methods:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="note">IsAlive</span> Function which prints whether or not this character is alive by looking into their hitpoints and determining whether they
          are above or below zero.</li>
          <li><span class="note">Attack</span> Function which takes in a second character's hitpoints and subtracts this character's strength from it.</li>
          <li><span class="note">LevelUp</span> Function which increases this character's Age by 1, their Strength by 5, and their HitPoints by 25.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="bonus">Bonus:</span>  After completing the previous sections and making sure they work, you now have everything you need to create a very basic
        RPG where two characters fight one another. Don't worry if you cannot finish this part of the activity as, by completing
        the above sections you are well on your way to mastering constructors!</p>
