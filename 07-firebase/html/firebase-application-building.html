      <section>
        <h1>Administrivia</h1>
        <p>Welcome to day two of Firebase!</p>
        <p>Let's begin with questions, things you're stuck on, eye-opening revelations, neat stuff you
          might have figured out or built, etc.
        </p>
        <p>Stumped about <code>.set({})</code>? Really confused on <code>ref()</code>? Feel free to ask
        questions. Otherwise, we'll jump right into today's session.</p>
        <p>Today's class will be dedicated to building more complex applications with Firebase using
          some new capabalities and library functions.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Application Overview</h1>
        <p>You'll be spending a good portion of this class recreating an employee timesheet apllication
          which uses Firebase to track employee names, roles, start dates, lengths of employment,
           monthly rates, and total amounts billed.
        </p>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <p>I'll demo the timesheet application's frontend shortly.</p>
          <p>We won't be looking at the Firebase storage quite yet, just focusing on the functionality
            provided for us.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Class activity!</h2>
          <h3>Where's the data?</h3>
          <p>Discuss these two questions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Which fields <span class="bold">must</span> be in the database?</li>
            <li>Which fields can we avoid sending to the database in favor of calculating locally?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <p>Now, let's look at how the backend works, side-by-side with the client.</p>
          <p>As I demo it, pay special attention to how some fields are inputted on the client side,
            and how the remaining fields are calculated using the initial inputs.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>Why might this approach have advantages over uploading every calculated field into
          into the database?
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>The main reason for limiting the data we store on the backend is that we drastically
          reduce the amount of updates we have to send to the database every month&mdash;or, in some cases,
          every second&mdash; employees' tenures grow.
        </p>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Group activity!</h2>
          <h3>Phase I: Main Application Design</h3>
          <p>This activity will be for focusing your efforts on creating the application layout for the site.</p>
          <p>This phase involves:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Creating the overall HTML/CSS/Bootstrap Layout</li>
            <li>Creating the initial <code>.on("click")</code> event that will dynamically trigger new HTML 
              rows to be generated.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This phase does <span class="italic">not</span> involve sending or receiving data to/from Firebase.</p>
          <p>If you finish early:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Continue refining the design! Take things to the next level.
              Make this application portfolio-grade!</li>
            <li>Begin reading about
            <code>push({})</code> and <code>.on("child_added")</code> in the Firebase documentation.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <p>By this point, everyone should have an initial design completed. Unlike other activities,
          completed code will not be provided, so be sure you have something. If your group does not,
          during the next phase we'll help you get up to speed.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <h3>Intro to Push</h3>
          <p>As a quick break from development, we're going to look at some new syntax.</p>
          <p>I'll be demoing an application we've worked on before, and it will still have the same
            functionality.
          </p>
          <p>Everything is fine with it, but why don't we try changing the <code>.set({})</code>
          method with <code>.push({})</code>? What will happen?</p>
          <p>We'll be able to directly observe how Firebse creates new entries as "children" instead of
            just overwriting existing data. After this demonstration, we will return to our main task.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Group activity!</h2>
          <h3>Phase II: Push Phase</h3>
          <p>Using your newfound knowledge of the <code>.push({})</code> method, create the code 
            necessary to push employee data into the database upon clicking the "submit" button on your
            webpage.</p>
          <p><span class="note">Note</span>: Don't worry about getting the data to display in the HTML just
          yet. Just focus on getting data pushed to the database.</p>
          <p>If you finish early, begin reading about <code>.on("child_added")</code> in
          the Firebase documentation and/or the MomentJS library.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <h3>Intro to <span class="monospace italic">child_added</span></h3>
          <p>Another quick break for new functionality!</p>
          <p>The previous "recent user" example has been expanded to not only showcase the most recent users,
            but also to create a running list of users.</p>
            <p>he Firebase Database is keeping a running list of all the users as "children"â€”we're
              using a new Firebase method to retrieve and display the children data in our HTML.</p>
            <p>Let's walk through the code and see what's new.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Group activity!</h2>
          <h3>Phase III: <span class="monospace italic">child_added</span></h3>
          <p>Using your newfound knowledge of the <code>.on("child_added")</code> method, begin to retrieve your
            employee data from the database and populating the records into your table.</p>
          <p><span>Note:</span> Don't worry about calculating Months Worked or the Total Billed just yet.
            Just focus on retrieving the data that is already in the database.
          <p>If you finish easily, continue refining the aesthetics of your website,
            consider incorporating "update" or "delete" employee buttons,
            or begin reading up on the MomentJS library.</p>

        <h1>Break time!</h1>
      </div>
      <section>
        <h1>MomentJS &#x23F1;</h1>
        <p>Dates in JavaScript are weird: they're finicky, hard to get right due to their really picky
          date formatting syntax. It quickly becomes a pain to format a given string as a date.
        </p>
        <p>Enter <span class="note">MomentJS</span>! It's a library that provides a standardized set
        of tools for parsing, adding, subtracting, and comparing datetimes. We can look up some examples and play
        with it in our console.</p>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <h3>MomentJS practice</h3>
          <p>Let's take a moment to play with this new library. Keep in mind that as a developer, one of the
            things you'll have to learn how to do is read documentation for something new,
            then quickly be able to use it. In this case, you will use more advanced features of the MomentJS library.
          </p>
          <p>Check out <code>momentjs-activity.html</code> in <code>20-MomentJS</code>.</p>
          <p>Complete each of the activities listed in the comments.</p>
          <p><span class="note">Note:</span> You don't need to go in order.</p>
          <p><span class="note">Note:</span> Don't let the simple
            example fool you. Working with a new library can be tough.
            Be prepared to get frustrated. Stick with it!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="review">
          <h2>MomentJS Activity Review</h2>
          <p>Which questions did you get? Which were difficult?</p>
          <p>Let's walk through the code.</p>

        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Group activity!</h2>
          <h3>Phase IV: DateTimes</h3>
          <p>Now that you've had some practice with MomentJS, time to complete the employee tracker application.</p>
          <p>You'll need to use the library to calculate the number of months
            worked and subsequently, the total amount billed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="review">
          <h2>Employee Timesheet Review</h2>
          <p>We'll be going over the code somewhat lightlyâ€”this code is extremely similar to your homework,
            so you are encouraged to take another look at it yourselves.

          <h3>Traintime Prediction Math</h3>
          <p>Let's look at the easier version of your homework due next week.</p>
          <p>As a reminder of its functionality, in this application, administrators input the time
             for the first train of the day and the frequency with which a train arrives
             at a station. With this information the application <span class="italic">automatically</span>
             calculates the next arrival time.</p>
          <p>The math behind this might get a little bit tricky. With your group write out the steps you would use
            mathematically to determine the answer to the following situation assuming:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The first train of the day comes in at 3:00 AM.</li>
              <li>The train runs every 17 minutes</li>
              <li>The current time is 7:12 PM.</li>
              <li>There have been no delays and will be no delays.
                <span class="gray italic">(must be nice, right?)</span></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Question: How many minutes away is the next train?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Let's use this time to talk about the code necessary. We'll take a look at the train example given
            and use the comments to determine how we can calculate the difference we want.</p>
        </div>
