        <h1>Administrivia</h1>
        <p>Welcome to day two of Firebase!</p>
        <p>Let's begin with questions, things you're stuck on, eye-opening revelations, neat stuff you
          might have figured out or built, etc.
        </p>
        <p>Stumped about <code>.set({})</code>? Really confused on <code>ref()</code>? Feel free to ask
        questions. Otherwise, we'll jump right into today's session.</p>
        <p>Today's class will be dedicated to building more complex applications with Firebase using
          some new capabalities and library functions.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Application Overview</h1>
        <p>You'll be spending a good portion of this class recreating an employee timesheet apllication
          which uses Firebase to track employee names, roles, start dates, lengths of employment,
           monthly rates, and total amounts billed.
        </p>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <p>I'll demo the timesheet application's frontend shortly.</p>
          <p>We won't be looking at the Firebase storage quite yet, just focusing on the functionality
            provided for us.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Class activity!</h2>
          <h3>Where's the data?</h3>
          <p>Discuss these two questions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Which fields <span class="bold">must</span> be in the database?</li>
            <li>Which fields can we avoid sending to the database in favor of calculating locally?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <p>Now, let's look at how the backend works, side-by-side with the client.</p>
          <p>As I demo it, pay special attention to how some fields are inputted on the client side,
            and how the remaining fields are calculated using the initial inputs.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>Why might this approach have advantages over uploading every calculated field into
          into the database?
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>The main reason for limiting the data we store on the backend is that we drastically
          reduce the amount of updates we have to send to the database every month&mdash;or, in some cases,
          every second&mdash; employees' tenures grow.
        </p>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Group activity!</h2>
          <h3>Phase I: Main Application Design</h3>
          <p>This activity will be for focusing your efforts on creating the application layout for the site.</p>
          <p>This phase involves:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Creating the overall HTML/CSS/Bootstrap Layout</li>
            <li>Creating the initial <code>.on("click")</code> event that will dynamically trigger new HTML 
              rows to be generated.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This phase does <span class="italic">not</span> involve sending or receiving data to/from Firebase.</p>
          <p>If you finish early:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Continue refining the design! Take things to the next level.
              Make this application portfolio-grade!</li>
            <li>Begin reading about
            <code>push({})</code> and <code>.on("child_added")</code> in the Firebase documentation.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <p>By this point, everyone should have an initial design completed. Unlike other activities,
          completed code will not be provided, so be sure you have something. If your group does not,
          during the next phase we'll help you get up to speed.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <h3>Intro to Push</h3>
          <p>As a quick break from development, we're going to look at some new syntax.</p>
          <p>I'll be demoing an application we've worked on before, and it will still have the same
            functionality.
          </p>
          <p>Everything is fine with it, but why don't we try changing the <code>.set({})</code>
          method with <code>.push({})</code>? What will happen?</p>
          <p>We'll be able to directly observe how Firebse creates new entries as "children" instead of
            just overwriting existing data. After this demonstration, we will return to our main task.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Group activity!</h2>
          <h3>Phase II: Push Phase</h3>
          <p>Using your newfound knowledge of the <code></code>.push({})</code> method, create the code 
            necessary to push employee data into the database upon clicking the "submit" button on your
            webpage.</p>
          <p><span class="note">Note</span>: Don't worry about getting the data to display in the HTML just
          yet. Just focus on getting data pushed to the database.</p>
          <p>If you finish early, begin reading about <code>.on("child_added")</code> in
          the Firebase documentation and/or the MomentJS library.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <h3>Intro to <span class="monospace italic">child_added</span></h3>
          <p>Another quick break for new functionality!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Group activity!</h2>
          <h3>Phase III: <span class="monospace italic">child_added</span></h3>
          <p>Using your newfound knowledge of the <code>.on("child_added")</code> method, begin to retrieve your
            employee data from the database and populating the records into your table.</p>
          <p><span>Note:</span> Don't worry about calculating Months Worked or the Total Billed just yet.
            Just focus on retrieving the data that is already in the database.
          <p>If you finish easily, continue refining the aesthetics of your website,
            consider incorporating "update" or "delete" employee buttons,
            or begin reading up on the MomentJS library.</p>

        <p>The link to the a checkpoint quiz for your knowledge of timers and APIs will be Slacked out
          to you. As a reminder, reminded that this quiz is not graded, and cannot hinder your ability to
          complete the course. It exists so that we can gauge your progress and knowledge/skill retention.

        <p>During office hours, we can review the answers to the checkpoint if you'd like.</p>
