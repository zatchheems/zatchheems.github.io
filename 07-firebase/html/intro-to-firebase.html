        <h1>Administrivia</h1>
        <p>Last class, we talked about data persistence as well as client and server-side storage.
          Today's lesson will continue utilizing the concept of data persistence, applying it to server-side
          storage with <span class="note">Firebase</span>. We'll be learning Firebase primarily through
          examples, so this will be an activity-heavy, individual work-centric class.
        </p>
        <p><span class="note">Firebase</span> is
          an easy-to-use server-side database that makes it easy to power
          our front-end applications with expansive datasets. Unlike previous classes, we will be beginning
          to dive into backend technologies—up to this point, everything has been written in the front-end.
        </p>
        <h2>Questions up to this point? Review?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          As a general warning, please begin the homework <span class="italic">as soon as possible!</span>
          This homework is very challenging, and what makes it challenging isn't the "new" stuff.
          The challenge is getting a handle on increasingly complex javascript logic,
          especially the multiplayer RPS game.

        <h1>Firebase</h1>
        <p><span class="note">In short:</span> Firebase offers an extremely easy to use system for relaying
          data between your application and their dedicated platforms.</p>
        <p>It offers an easy to use, intuitive GUI for seeing your data in real-time.</p>
        <p>It offers near instantaneous transmission of data between the Firebase database and your application.
          Of specific importance is the concept of "real-time" data binding
        (i.e. when your data changes in the database it will <span class='bold'>immediately</span> reflect
        that change in your application.)</p>
        <p>Firebase website:
          <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank" title="Firebase site">https://firebase.google.com/</a>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Class activity!</h2>
          <p>Follow along with me as I create a new Firebase. The steps are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Click "Get Started For Free"</li>
            <li>Login with your Google account</li>
            <li>Click "Create New Project"</li>
            <li>Name your database whatever you like, as long as the name is unique</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once you have a Firebase app, click "Database" on the left navbar.</p>
          <p>The displayed URL is where all of the data will get stored.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="note">Note: </span>It is important to note that by default Firebase requires authentication
            to read/write to a new database.
          </p>
          <p>
            To complete exercises without worrying about authentication, you need to set your database rules to "public".
            Please click the "rules" tab, set both ".read" and ".write" to true, and then click Publish.
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h3>Next, let's look at how to use Firebase to store and update data in real-time.</h3>
        <hr>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <p>Let's take a look at an application that uses Firebase and a simple button click to store data and
            update it.
          </p>
          <p>Then, we'll look at the code behind the app.</p>
          <p class="bold">Things to Watch For:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Inclusion of the Firebase.js file</li>
            <li>Firebase config and initialization</li>
            <li>Creation of a reference to the database (i.e.
            <code>var database = firebase.database()</code>)</li>
            <li>The use of <code>.set()</code> to save the data to the database
            <li>The use of <code>.ref()</code> to specify
            where the data will be saved. Since there is nothing inside the parentheses
            the data is saved to the database's root directory.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note that there is no HTML changing in this app—just Firebase data.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Class activity!</h2>
          <p>
            Navigate to your app's overview page and click "Add Firebase to your web app".
            You should see a snippet of code giving you the Firebase source script, a <code>config</code>
            object and code to initialize Firebase itself.
          </p>
          <p>Using this snippet, replace the Firebase config object in the click button app
            with the config from <span class="italic">your own</span> Firebase database. This object
            tells Firebase the URL of your database.</p>
          <p>
            Click the button a few times and notice the changes being made to the database.
            Everyone should have a working connection by the end of this activity.
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <p>Talk amongst yourselves about the code you've seen thus far.</p>
        <p>Pay deep attention to the process of setting up a new Firebase and <code>.set()</code> specifically.</p>
        <hr>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Class activity!</h2>
          <p>We're going to continue looking at the click button app we have.</p>
          <p>As I click, the numbers change. This isn't necessarily groundbreaking&mdash;the really cool part is how I can close my tab and reopen it and find the same data still there,
          without <code>localStorage</code>.</p>
          <p>What's cooler than that? Having multiple tabs open and having the data update automatically between
            all of them. Let's check that out!</p>
          <hr>
          <p>For the last part of this activity, in your browser, open up the original file that contains the unedited
            version of the Firebase config such that we all have the same file open.</p>
          <p>Feel free to mash the button as much as you want! Notice that you don't even need to refresh
            the page to see this instantaneous change. Even if we were to use <code>localStorage</code>,
            it wouldn't be possible for the same data to be altered and shared across multiple browsers and/or
            computers if we were deploy it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="review">
          <h2>In-Depth Review</h2>
          <p>We're going to walk through the code again.</p>
          <p>The key aspects of this file include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>database = firebase.database()</code> references the database</li>
            <li><code>.set({})</code> saves data</li>
            <li><code>.ref()</code> specifies where the data will be saved</li>
            <li><code>.on("value", function(){})</code> creates an on-change event with a callback function
            that executes when the page is loaded or when the database changes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Why is this cool? What can we use this for?</p>

        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <h3>Clickbutton Comments</h3>
          <p>Open up <code>instructor-do-clickbutton-nocomments.html</code>. One last time,
            go through this file and comment each of the lines of code with what you think is happening
            on that line.</p>
          <p>If you finish early visit the Realtime Database Getting Started Guide (<a href = "https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start" title="Realtime Database Getting Started Guide" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start</a>).</p>

        <div class="review">
          <h2>Click Button Comments Review</h2>
          <p>We're going to walk through the code (yet) again, focusing on the comments.</p>

          <h3>Countdown Counter</h3>
          <p>I'm going to demo an application before you build it. You'll have two choices in difficulty.</p>
          <p>
            Using either <code>logic.js</code> (easier) or <code>logicOption2.js</code> (harder) in <code>11-countdownbutton</code>, create the click
            down activity using a Firebase database to store the click data on the backend.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your application should be able to run on multiple browser windows simultaneously and register click
          events on each screen correctly.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="review">
          <h2>Countdown Activity Review</h2>
          <p>Let's walk throught the code, stopping where people had issues.</p>
          <p>It's important to emphasize that there are effectively two pieces in play when trasmitting and receiving
            data from a Firebase server: <code>on.("value")</code> for retrieval and <code>.set</code> for setting
            data.</p>
        </div>

          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <p>I'll be demoing another Firebase-based app. This one changes multiple properties, all associated
            with the same database. Changes are reflected in both the Firebase database and in the HTML of this application.</p>
          <p>Let's dig into the code!</p>

          <h3>Most Recent User</h3>
          <p>I'll be demonstrating your next activity shortly. The most recent user is changing in realtime to replace
            the old content when new data is submitted.</p>
          <p>You'll be attempting to create a webpage that achieves this functionality. The finished product should
            save the newest user to a Firebase database and change the HTML.
        </div>
        <div class="review">
          <h2>Most Recent User Review</h2>
          <p>As we go over the code, again we should be focusing on the key aspects: the <code>on.("value")</code>
            to track changes, the <code>.set({})</code> to add data, etc.</p>

          <p>This application will take longer to complete than the other activities we've had today.
            I'll demo it first.
          </p>
          <p>Using either <code>logic.js</code> (easier) or <code>logicOption2.js</code> (harder) in
          <code>14-codersbay</code>, create the CodersBay app using a Firebase
          database to store data on the backend.</p>

          <h2>CodersBay Review</h2>
          <p>The <code>on.("value")</code> method
            to track changes and <code>.set({})</code> method to add data should start to become familiar by now.</p>
          <p>If this isn't quite clicking yet, don't worry! It will likely take a couple more hours of playing with
            this new technology to understand how it works. Once you understand it, you'll be able to do the homework.

          <p>After we open up a bunch of instances to see how it works, we'll <span class="italic">lightly</span>
          go over the code to see why it functions the way it does. We'll be paying special attention to
