      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Good morning, all! Congratulations on finishing your projects. The hard work you all put in was clearly evident in
        the quality of your applications. Before we begin today's lesson on MongoDB and NoSQL, let's take inventory of your
        thoughts about the project in the form of a plus/delta (+/&Delta;) list.
      </p>
      <p>With the technologies you've learned thus far, most of you are already hireable. This would be a great time to start
        looking for employment if you want to find work now. The roadmap for the rest of the cohort will include MongoDB/NoSQL, React, some computer science and other technologies.
        Without further ado, let's get into MongoDB!
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Intro to MongoDB</h1>
      <p>What's a NoSQL database? Simply put, a NoSQL database doesn't use SQL's table-based relationship model.
        Instead, MongoDB uses a <span class="note">document-oriented model</span>. One of the most convenient parts of NoSQL databases
        is that they store data as BSON, or "Binary JSON". When these objects get returned, they are usable as
        regular JSON objects. It's important to note that ongoDB is still an inherently different style of data storage than MySQL.
        A BSON document is basically a more flexible
        JSON, and individual documents can include strings, ints, booleans and even other objects.</p>
      <p>Relational databases such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc. rely on joins to get data from multiple tables.
        A BSON version of this data doesn't always need to be joined for certain complex data structures, since BSON supports Objects Within Objects.
        Once we get this data toa site, it's a cinch to traverse&mdash;it's the same routine as picking out JSON
        data.
      </p>
      <p>Lastly, MongoDB has tons of drivers and packages for connecting to Node, C++, Java, Ruby, Python, etc.
      This means that we can use this tech for pretty much any project you can think of</p>
      <h2>Quick Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What are the advantages of using a NoSQL database like MongoDB according to the MongoDB Website?</li>
        <li>What are the advantages of using a NoSQL database like MongoDB according to the web?</li>
        <li>What are the disadvantages of using a NoSQL database like MongoDB according to the web?</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <p>From the MongoDB site:</p>
      <blockquote>"Relational databases require that schemas be defined before you can add data. For example, you might want to store
      data about your customers such as phone numbers, first and last name, address, city and state – a SQL database needs to
      know what you are storing in advance... Object-oriented programming that is easy to use and flexible."</blockquote>
      <hr>
      <blockquote>Deep query-ability. MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language that's nearly
      as powerful as SQL. No schema migrations. Since MongoDB is schema-free, your code defines your schema.</blockquote>
      <hr>
      <blockquote>Sometimes, using joins and having strict schemas is actually preferable to MongoDB.
      "If your database has a lot of relations and normalization, it might make little sense to use something like MongoDB.
      It's all about finding the right tool for the job."</blockquote>

      <p>Make sure your installation of MongoDB works properly&mdash;we're about to start our first queries!</p>

    <h3>Starting With Mongo</h3>
    <p>Check out <span class="mono">02-Starting-With-Mongo</span>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use the command line to create a classroom database. Insert entries for yourself and the people in your row in a
        students collection. Each document should have:
      </li>
      <ol>
        <li>A field of name with the person's name.</li>
        <li>A field of rownumber which will contain the row number that they are in.</li>
        <li>A field of os which will contain the Operating System of the computer they are using: 'Mac', 'Win', etc</li>
        <li>A field of hobbies with an array of the hobbies the person likes to do.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Use find commands to get:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>A list of everyone in your row.</li>
        <li>An entry for a single person.</li>
        <li>The entries for all the Mac users in your row.</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="bonus">Bonus:</span> If you finish early, check out the MongoDB documentation and figure out how to find users by an entry in an array.</p>

    <h2>Starting With Mongo</h2>
    <p>Let's go over the queries necessary to fill this collection with the required info.</p>

  <p>Now, let's check out <span class='mono'>03-Update-Delete-and-Drop</span> and demo the commands contained within.
    We want to be able to remove,
    update and drop data within MongoDB. I'll demo this functionality for you.

        <h3>Taking Candy from Basket Weavers</h3>
        <p>
          Open up <span class="mono">04-Student-Update-Delete-and-Drop</span> and go back to your classroom database.
        </p>
        <p>
          You've decided to take on a new hobby. Add Extreme Basket Weaving to your array of hobbies.
        </p>
        <p>While practicing for your Extreme Basket Weaving Competition, you broke the computer of the person next to you. They're
        using a new Operating System now. Change their os field.</p>
        <p>Another student in your row saw you break that computer and wisely decided to move. Remove them from your database.</p>
        <p>You are worried everyone else will leave and you'll have to sit all alone. You decide to bribe everyone who didn’t
        leave with candy. Add a field of gavecandy with a value of false to everyone in the array so you can keep track.</p>
        <p>All this work made you hungry, so you bought yourself some candy. Change the value of gavecandy to true in your entry.</p>
