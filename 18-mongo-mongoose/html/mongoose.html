      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Good evening, everyone! Today's class will build on your existing Mongo knowledge and extend it further. Just like with Sequelize
        and SQL, the material we will be going over today makes your Mongo workflow just a teensy bit easier, and a <span class="italic">lot</span>
        more flexible. We've been going over a lot of technology fairly quickly this week; to make sure
        it's all friend in your minds, let's get right into this lesson with a warm-up!
      </p>

     <h1>Mongo Warm-Up</h1>
    <div class="student-activity">
      <h2>Student activity!</h2>
      <h3>Mongo Warm-Up</h3>
      <p>Check out <span class="mono">13-Warm-Up</span>. The finished version of this application allows one to 
      add books, and mark books as read or unread.</p>
      <p>Your goal is to complete the routes in the server file so the site can display and edit the book data. Don't worry about
      the front end, just use MongoJS to finish the routes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="review">
      <h2>Warm-Up Review</h2>
      <p>Let's go over this quickly, and stop anywhere there may be questions or unclear steps.</p>
    </div>
   </section>
   <section>
     <h1>Intro to Mongoose</h1>
     <p>Mongo is very flexible, and makes it a cinch to save and retrieve data. However, sometimes we need to be stricter.
      We don't want to save <span class="mono">true</span> or an actual array as a book, or save a book without a
      title, or save a book with the same name and author. Nevertheless, the flexibility of MongoDB makes that possible.</p>
      <p>Pivoting to a more relational use-case: sometimes, we want to combine two collections for information.
        What if we have our authors and their books stored separately? How would we display a list of all author data along
        with all of the books they wrote? Relational databases make that possible with joins, but how do we do that with MongoDB?</p>
      <h2>Enter <span class="mono">Mongoose</span></h2>
      <p>Mongoose is to Mongo as Sequelize is to SQL. Pretty nice that we have that convenient analogy. Some of things we can use in
        Mongoose are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lets us define models for our Mongo data such that there are no surprise data types for particular fields</li>
        <li>Set required fields</li>
        <li>Create custom functions to handle our data in ways that aren't already baked into the framework</li>
        <li>Combine collections with <code>populate</code>, a method that offers very similar functionality to a SQL join</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>When should we use it?</h2>
      <p>We should use Mongoose when we want the simplicity of parsing BSON data in a website along with the same kinds of benefits
        that MySQL schemas offer. In this way, we leverage the most convenient parts of SQL in a NoSQL environment.
      </p>
   </section>
   <section>
     <h1>Models</h1>
     <p>In order to get a feel for the tech we'll be using, let's check out <span class="mono">14-SchemaExample</span>. We want
    to pay attention to two files in particular: <span class="mono">server.js</span> and <span class="mono">exampleModel.js</span>.
    Main concepts to pay attention to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="mono">server.js</span> loads Mongoose, uses the URL path of the MongoDB database to connect with MongoDB</li>
      <li><span class="mono">server.js</span> loads in <span class="mono">exampleModel.js</span> with <code class="language-javascript">require</code>;
      this model is similar to that of a Sequelize model, defining a schema for it then using the model to query a DB</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We'll pay attention to how we set up a schema class, define a schema, then use it to create a model. After that, we use the model's
      <code>create</code> method, accepting an object that describes the new document to be inserted.</p>
    <hr>
    <div class="student-activity">
      <h2>Student activity!</h2>
      <h3>Make a Model Schema</h3>
      <p>Check out <span class="mono">15-User-Schema</span>. I'll demo this for you shortly. What this app does within Mongoose
        is validate that there aren't any duplicate emails.</p>
      <p>The instructions are outlined in the assignment; your work consists of fleshing out a schema already outlined for you.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="review">
      <h2>Model Schema Review</h2>
      <p>Let's check out how this schema looks.</p>
    </div>
    <p>What if we want more functionality than what these schema properties offer?</p>
    <p>What if we want to create new entries with the information that the user sends automatically?
      If we wanted a full-name field that gets created on the fly, we can do so by concatenating the first and last name of a user in a
      custom method. Maybe we simply want to update a field with a simple function call in our server file.
    </p>
    <p>Let's check out an example file in <span class="mono">16-Custom-Methods</span>, paying particular attention to <span class="mono">server.js</span>,
    <span class="mono">usermodel.js</span> and <span class="mono">public/index.html</span>. This particular example makes changes to users
    as they get inserted into the database. We'll be going over <span class="mono">userModel.js</span>
    first.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Any questions on the files we just went over?</p>
    <hr>
    <div class="student-activity">
      <h2>Student activity!</h2>
      <h3>Custom Methods</h3>
      <p>Crack open <span class="mono">17-Custom-Method-Exercise</span>. Your work should be done in <span class="mono">server.js</span>
      and <span class="mono">userModel.js</span>. Your instructions are as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to userModel.js, and create custom methods based on the details offered in the file.</li>
        <li>Once you've made those custom methods, use them in this file's <span class="mono">POST</span> request.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="review">
      <h2>Custom Methods Review</h2>
      <p>Let's go over a solved <span class="mono">server.js</span> and <span class="mono">userModel.js</span>.</p>
