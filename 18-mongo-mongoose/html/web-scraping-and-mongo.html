    <section>
      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Good evening, everyone! Welcome to day two of our discussion on MongoDB and NoSQL. By this point,
        Mongo should still seem fresh but familiar in a way&mdash;think Firebase. The storage of data in BSON,
        relation-less collections and ease-of-use should seem remarkably similar. Before we begin, let's get any questions,
        comments, or concerns about this new tech, be it usage, popularity in the wild, advantages/disadvantages, etc.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Web Scraping</h1>
      <p class='no-letter'>What is <span class="note">web scraping</span>? This is a common topic in web development; if you already
      know about it, explain what it is in your own words.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Simply put, web scraping is essentially a programmatic means of taking data from any web site. Programmers mark sections of a site
      for their apps to scrape (certain divs, certain element tags, etc.), which lets them store site data elsewhere.
      Why might we want to do that? Why are there legal ramifications for scraping certain sites?</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Truth be told, it's a bit of a gray area. Web scraping is not a lawful solution for every project.
        Within the last year, certain projects and companies have been slapped with hefty fines for scraping at-scale.
        This begs the question: <span class="italic">is it worth it?</span> In situations where the data is acquired lawfully, oftentimes it is.
        This class will be partially focused on executing our own web scraping using an npm package called <span class="mono">cheerio</span>.
      </p>
      <h2>Using Cheerio</h2>
      <p>Let's check out the <a href="https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio">Cheerio documentation (https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio)</a>.
      We'll notice how the syntax looks remarkably similar to a technology we used a while ago... nearly identical, in fact.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>Using Cheerio</h1>
  <p class="no-letter">First things first, I'm going to demonstrate how to use Cheerio. Please follow along with me:</p>
  <div class="activity">
    <h2>Class activity!</h2>
    <p>Open up <span class="mono">05-Scraping</span> to follow along with me. As a reminder, you'll need to <code class="language-bash">npm install</code>
    to get all the necessary packages.</p>
    <p>Let's check out a website we'd like to scrape, then crack open <span class="mono">server.js</span> to see what will happen. 
    We want to pay special attention to the <span class="mono">request package</span>, usage of <code>$</code> as a variable
    <span class="muted italic">(any guesses as to why?)</span> and the usage.</p>
    <p>Then, we'll check out the other server files.</p>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div class="student-activity">
    <h2>Student activity!</h2>
    <h3>Web Scraping Starter</h3>
    <p>Check out <span class="mono">06-Scrape-Starter</span>.</p>
    <p>Using this template, the cheerio documentation, and what you've learned in class so far, scrape a website of your
    choice, save information from the page in a result array, and log it to the console.</p>
    <p>The file will include sections marked off where you should add your code.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="review">
    <h2>Web Scraping Starter Review</h2>
    <p>What sites did everyone choose and why? How did everyone go about selecting the elements you wanted to scrape?</p>
    <p>Did anyone find it difficult or not possible to get the data they wanted from just the HTML? Keep in mind that much of the data
      we provide in our own sites requires client-side JavaScript. When we disable it, oftentimes we don't get anything we want whatsoever.
      This is evident on sites where when we disable JavaScript in a browser's dev tools.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>Pretty interesting stuff. <span class="accent italic">And now, time for something completely different!</span></p>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>Mongo Practice and MongoJS</h1>
  <p>Some of you may be wondering how this all figures into what we learned yesterday. Well, it will all make sense by the end of
  class; all of this is going to tie together rather neatly.
  For now, we're going to swing back to MongoDB, and this time, get it to interact with Node.</p>
  <div class="student-activity">
    <h2>Student activity!</h2>
    <h3>Zoo DB</h3>
    <p>Startup <span class="mono">mongod</span> and the mongo shell and switch to a new db named zoo.</p>
    <p>Insert into a collection named <span class="mono">animals</span>:
    One entry for each of your five favorite animals.</p>
    <p>Each entry should have:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A field of <code>numLegs</code> with an integer of the number of legs that animal has.</li>
      <li>A field of <code>class</code> with that animal's class (mammal, reptile, etc).</li>
      <li>A field of <code>weight</code> with an integer of the weight of the animal in pounds (any reasonable weight, really).</li>
      <li>A field of <code>name</code>, with the animal's name.</li>
      <li>A field of <code>whatIWouldReallyCallIt</code> with the name of what you would call the animal if you got to name it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>An example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "name": "Zebra",
  "numLegs": 4,
  "class": "mammal",
  "weight": 880,
  "whatIWouldReallyCallIt": "DOUBLEHORSE"
}</code></pre>
  </div>
  <div class="review">
    <h2>Zoo DB Review</h2>
    <p>This should have been a relatively easy assignment. Please feel free to ask questions if you need something cleared up.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Sorting With MongoDB</h2>
  <p>Before we get Mongo properly connected to Node, we have to be able to sort our data. This is possibly the last holdover from MySQL we
    haven't gone over. This is vital for organizing our data before displaying it on a website. Let's crack open <span class="mono">08-Sorting</span>
    and go through it line-by-line&mdash;feel free to try these commands as we go over them.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h2>MongoJS</h2>
  <p>Now that we've all become MongoDB masters, it's time to use our craft with Node. Let's look up <span class="mono">MongoJS</span> on the npm website.</p>
  <p>After doing so, we don't need to worry about connecting to the database just yet:
    the main focus is how to call the MongoDB methods we've already used. For instance, how would we find, insert, remove, and sort?</p>
    <p>The main theme here is that using these methods is nearly identical to running them in the <span class="mono">mongo</span> shell,
    just with a callback function to handle the results in a server. From there, it's really just using Express to
    send the data to the browser, same as we did with MySQL.</p>
  <div class="student-activity">
    <h2>Student activity!</h2>
    <h3>MongoJS and Sorting</h3>
    <p>In this activity, you will make four routes that display results from your zoo collection:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Root: Displays a simple "Hello World" message (no mongo required).</li>
      <li>All: Send JSON response with all animals</li>
      <li>Name: Send JSON response sorted by name in ascending order</li>
      <li>Weight: Send JSON response sorted by weight in descending order</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div class="review">
    <h2>MongoJS and Sorting Review</h2>
    <p>Let's go over the solution to this activity.</p>

<div class="page-break">
  <h1>Break time!</h1>
</div>
    <section>
      <h1>MongoJS + Front-end</h1>
      <p>Now that we have our back end working without MongoDB, we have one last component to add to make this a fullstack app:
        the front-end.</p>
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>MongoJS and the Front-end</h3>
        <p>I'm going to demo this activity, then you'll build it!</p>
        <p>Open up <span class="mono">10-MongoJS-and-the-Front-End</span> and check out <span class="mono">public/app.js</span>. The instructions
        within are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Make a reusable function for creating a table body in <span class="mono">index.html</span> with the results from your MongoDB query
            Each row should have info for one animal.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            Make two AJAX functions that fire when users click the two buttons on index.html.
            <ol>
              <li>When the user clicks the Weight button, the table should display the animal data sorted by weight.</li>
              <li>When the user clicks the Name button, the table should display the animal data sorted by name.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <p>Good luck!</p>
          <p><span class="hint">Hint:</span> We don't want to keep adding to the table with each button click. We only want to show the new results.
          What can we do to the table to accomplish this?</p>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <h1>Scraping Into MongoDB</h1>
      <p>Time to tie it all together! We've got scraping, <span class="mono">MongoJS</span> and MongoDB at our disposal
      to bring everything into the realm of full-stack. Today's final activity will have you do just that.</p>
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>Scraping Into a DB</h3>
        <p>Using the tools and techniques you learned so far,
        you will scrape a website of your choice, then place the data
        in a MongoDB database. Be sure to make the database and collection
        before running this exercise.</p>
        <p>You'll have to use two routes:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Route 1: This route will retrieve all of the data
          from the <span class="mono">scrapedData</span> collection as json (this will be populated
          by the data you scrape using the next route)</li>
          <li>Route 2:
          When you visit this route, the server will
          scrape data from the site of your choice, and save it to
          MongoDB.
          <span class="hint">Tip:</span> Think back to how you pushed website data
          into an empty array earlier in the class. How do you
          push it into a MongoDB collection instead?</li>
