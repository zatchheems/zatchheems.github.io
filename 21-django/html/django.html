      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Good evening, all! We'll be continuing our discussion of Python by introducing <span class="note">Django</span>, one of the most
      popular Python web frameworks. It is an MVC framework, representing the Model-View-Controller methodology quite well, and should seem
      like an interesting mix between Mongoose/Sequelize and Express. Much of this will seem totally weird and alien, since Python is new to you.
      <span class="muted italic">(Full disclosure: Python's not my best language. Your patience is appreciated.)</span>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h1>Python and <span class="mono">virtualenv</span> Setup</h1>
    <p>Before we begin, we will verify that our environments are identical&mdash;barring operating system differences, of course&mdash;such that
      we don't have any version-specific problems or errors. The same rings true for Node and NPM versions: different versions will actually function
      differently. It is common to use <abbr title="Node Version Manager">NVM</abbr> for Node.</p>
    <p>However, since we're in Python land, we have some different tools to manage, specifically Python itself. Python 3.x is the version we want. Many
    older machines come with 2.7.x by default. This difference in numbering is known as a <span class="note">major revision</span>, and as such, breaks a
    lot of old stuff and adds a lot of new stuff. Run the following to check that you have Python 3 and above:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">python --version</code></pre>
    <p>If you're rocking above 3.0, you're in good hands. You can immediately run the following to initialize a new virtual environment, which will
    keep a totally standalone, local instance of whatever is inside it (just like installing Node packages locally):</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash"># replace "env" here with whatever you like.
ENV="env"
virtualenv $ENV</code></pre>
    <p>For those with Python versions less than 3, your command will look like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash"># env can be whatever you like, but should be the same as above
virtualenv -p `which python3` env</code></pre>
    <p>You can find the path to your Python3 install by running <code class="language-bash">which python3</code>. You can use inline
    command substitution to do this with backticks ("`"), like above.</p>
    <p>To activate the virtualenv, run:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">source $ENV_NAME/Scripts/activate</code></pre>
    <p>Easy as that, hopefully. We'll help troubleshoot any rockiness along the way.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Django and the MVC</h1>
      <p>As mentioned briefly before, Django is an MVC framework. Why is this important?
        Well, say you're building a Node app with Express. You have complete control over 
        <i class="italic">exactly</i> how you'd like your data to be saved and structured.
        This is powerful, but super inconvenient, as you are now required to "glue" everything
        together manually.
      </p>
      <p>This brings into question the advantages of convention of configuration.
        It's like the ease of use of React vs. the lightness and customizability of Handlebars.
        One requires a lot more overhead; the other requires more code.
      </p>
      <p>Django favors convention. It follows a more M<span class="bold">T</span>C structure,
        using templates. Django's "views" have controller-like responsibilities. Think about 
        how Express can choose to send raw HTML. Upgrade that to accept Handlebars-like templates
        and we're good to go.</p>
      <h2>Django Installation and Create Project</h2>
      <p>Time to actually install this thing! Be sure to source your virtualenv if you haven't
        already. After doing so, use Python's package manager to install Django like so:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># note: you don't have to use pip3 within a virtualenv
pip install Django==1.10.1</code></pre>
      <p>Django provides a command-line tool for creating new projects called <span class="mono">django-admin</span>.
      Create a new project with the following:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># feel free to name it whatever you like.
# I'll be using "app"
django-admin startproject app</code></pre>
      <p>If you run <code>tree .</code>, you'll see the entirety of the app's contents.</p>
      <p>The <span class="mono">app</span> directory contains project-wide configuration filesâ€”this is where we set up database configuration, tell Django
      where static files are located, etc.</p>
      <p><span class="mono">manage.py</span> is where Django's utility toolchain lives.
      This is the tool you'll use to migrate databases, run the development server, create administrators, etc.</p>
      <p>This directory contains all of the files for a Django project, but we develop specific functionality in what
      Django calls <span class="note">apps</span>.
      Ideally, each app is responsible for a specific set of related features.
      A web app is a collection of different "feature sets." A Django project is the web app; each "feature set" is a Django
      app.</p>
      <p>To initialize a new app, we use the <span class="mono">manage.py</span> tool.
      Create a new app with <code class="language-bash">python manage.py startapp users</code>.
      The general formula is <code class="language-bash">pythonmanage.py startapp $APP_NAME.</code></p>
      <p>Running this command creates a new folder with our app name. This directory is where we'll spend
        most of our development time.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, when you create a new app like this, you need to "register" it in Django's internal settings
      file. This allows it to find important, app-specific files. Within <span class="mono">app/settings.py</span>,
      under <span class="mono">INSTALLED_APPS</span>, we'll add <span class="mono">users.apps.UsersConfig</span>
      to set up this new app called "users". This is a one-time thing we do for each new app.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Views and URLs</h1>
      <p>Since Django follows the MVC paradigm, we'll be exploring the Controller layer
        first, since this is what allows us to bind UIs to data. As a reminder, the 
        "controller" in MVC is called a "view" in Django. Let's check out <span class="mono">users/views.py</span>.
        This is where things might get confusing. You have to remember that <span class="mono">views.py</span>
        is where you define controllers, not UI details.
      </p>
      <p>Each view is just a Python function. When a user hits a URL/route on your website,
        Django calls a function defined in <span class="mono">views.py</span>, much like Express.
        It passes the request as a parameter to each view function&mdash;here's where you determine
      if it was a GET or POST. You need to tell Django which function to call when a user hits a given route elsewhere. We'll get to that after
      defining a few view functions.</p>
