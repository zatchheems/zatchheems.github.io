      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Good afternoon, everyone! Today's class will be focused on a totally new technology, complete with
        unfamiliar syntax, its own set of commands and applications, and completely different methodology. We're talking about <span class="note">SQL</span> of course,
        and <span class="note">MySQL</span> in particular. Today will be a little rough in some spots&mdash;unlike every other technology we've used previously,
        MySQL is rather difficult to use without a front-end if you are not a seasoned SQL developer, so we'll be using a front-end client to access the
        server. More on that later.
      </p>
      <p>On a different note, <span class="italic">congratulations are in order!</span> Today marks exactly half of the program's completion. Many of you started with
      no programming experience whatsoever. To consider your progress as anything less than remarkable would be an extreme understatement, so give yourselves a 
      proverbial pat on the back.</p>
      <p>With that done, let's start some SQL.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Intro to SQL and MySQL</h1>
      <p>Many of you have likely heard of SQL; pronounced either "ess-cue-ell" or "sequel", it stands for <span class="note">Structured Query Language</span>.
      What makes it different from languages such as JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, C, etc. is in the name: it's a <span class="note">declarative</span>
      language, meaning you <span class="italic">declare</span> what you want to do and the server will do it. Other languages are often imperative and/or
      functional. These languages require you to either define how to do something, or use a palette of built-in functions to accomplish that thing.
      With SQL, you build a query and it does the rest.</p>
      <p>The math, algorithms and data structures in database design are complex and extremely detailed&mdash;we're just interested in the language
        and what we can store in that database.
      </p>
      <h2>SQL and <span class="italic">My</span>SQL</h2>
      <p>MySQL is a popular open-source software for SQL development and database storage. Typically, MySQL runs as a server to which clients connect to.
        Much like Node, we can run this on our own machines. One of the big differences: Node is much easier to manage without a front-end, which is why we'll
        need a separate program for MySQL.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>MySQL Management</h1>
      <p>Our SQL front-end application of choice will be <a href="https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/" target="_blank">MySQL Workbench</a>
        on most platforms. MacOS users will likely want to install <a href="https://www.sequelpro.com/" target="_blank">Sequel Pro</a>, which runs natively
        and, full-disclosure, has a much prettier interface. Both of these products are free and open-source. If you haven't already,
        let's take some time to install your application of choice.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Now that we're all set up, we have to connect to a MySQL server. Since we don't have a dedicated remote server,
          we'll be running one locally.
        </p>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <p>I'll be demonstrating how to establish a connection to our own machine and referring to it using
          <code>localhost</code> and port <span class="mono">3306</span>. We're using a standard TCP/IP connection,
            which means that we're establishing the most basic standard form for connecting to a server.</p>
          <p>By default, the credentials will be <span class="mono">root</span> with no password.</p>
          <p>When we connect, we will not specify a default schema. More on what defines a schema later.</p>
          <p>We'll test the connection, then start it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <h3>Creating a LocalHost Connection</h3>
          <p>Either of these applications can be overwhelming at first&mdash;confusion is perfectly normal, and errors may occur. It's important to know
            how to handle these errors.
          </p>
          <p>Crack open your SQL front-end app. There should be a plus <span class="mid-accent">(+)</span> for new connections.</p>
          <p>Enter the following credentials into the on-screen prompt:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Connection Name: Local Instance MySQL</li>
            <li>Connection Method: Standard (TCP/IP)</li>
            <li>Hostname: localhost</li>
            <li>Port: 3306</li>
            <li>Username: &lt;Your MySQL Username> (Defaults to "root")</li>
            <li>Password: &lt;Your MySQL Password> (Defaults to empty)</li>
            <li>Keep the Default Schema field empty</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Hit "Test Connection" and, if the connection is successful, hit okay and double-click on the newly created field under the
          "MySQL Connections" text on the home page</p>
          <p>If the connection fails, raise your hand and one of us will come around to help you out. Until we come by, however, take
          this time to go online and see if there is anything online which might tell you what went wrong. Don't worry if you cannot
          find anything though, we will make sure to figure this out.</p>
          <p>If your connection was successful and you have nothing else to do, feel free to help those around you in creating their connections.</p>
          <p><span class="bonus">Bonus:</span> look into how you can create and use databases using SQL commands</p>
          <p><span class="bonus">Bonus:</span> look into the reasons why MySQL uses port 3306 as its default</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Connections Vs. Databases</h2>
        <p>Now that we have a connection to <span class="mono">localhost</span>, do we have a database available?</p>
        <p>In short: <span class="italic">nope!</span> Notice how no "schemas" are listed other than built-in and default databases, if any are listed at all.
          These normally do not appear on remote servers.</p>
        <p>Connecting to a server does not mean that you have created a database on that server. This means that, even if we wanted
        to, we could not yet populate our <span class="mono">localhost</span> connection with data until we create a database to house the data.</p>
        <p>The connection is a road which leads to an empty lot. Before we can populate the area, we first need to lay the foundations
        for houses (create a database), and build the houses (create a table). So, without further ado, let's make a database!</p>
        <p>Feel free to follow along with me, but know that it is not 100% necessary and I will be going rather quickly through it.</p>
        <p>SQL has two different types of formats: <abbr class="note" title="Data Definition Language">DDL</abbr> and
          <abbr class="note" title="Data Manipulation Language">DML</abbr>. We can use a tiny bit of DDL to make our first database. We'll be
          calling it <code>amimals_db</code>, and declaring it with this syntax:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE DATABASE &lt;database_name>;</code></pre>
        <p>We should see some confirmation that this occurred after we run it. If the database isn't visible, we can just refresh
          and it will become visible in the front-end.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>We have a database now, but no tables to store our data. Let's get some more DDL to define a table. Now that we have a database called
          <code>animals_db</code>, let's define a table that defines people and the pets they own.
        </p>
        <p><span class="note">Note:</span> for basic syntax and keywords, SQL is a case-insensitive language. For neatness, you can make keywords all-caps.
          My personal preference? All lowercase. You will see both formats. I'll be sticking with lowercase.   
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-sql">use animals_db;
create table people (
  name varchar(30) not null,
  has_pet boolean not null,
  peth_name varchar(30),
  pet_age integer(10)
);</code></pre>
    <p>When we run this, we have to make sure that we don't tell MySQL to run a duplicate command. Since MySQL data is persistent, it is not deleted
      or overwritten when identical commands are run unless specifically commanded to. If we have duplicate code, we can try to run only the highlighted
      code, or use comments:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-sql">--comments look this this on one line
 
/* they also look like this
    for multiline comments */</code></pre>
