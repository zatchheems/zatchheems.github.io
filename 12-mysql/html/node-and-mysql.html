      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Hello, everyone! Last time, despite some major hiccups we were able to declare databases, tables in that database,
        columns in those tables, and data in rows in those tables. All of this is great for data storage, manipulation,
        and retrieval. However, it's not very useful in a bubble&mdash;today, we'll be using Node to connect to your
        local MySQL server. After connecting to it, we'll be able to do all of the same commands as we can in a GUI-based
        SQL management software, or directly via the CLI.</p>
      <p>For those of you who had issues with installing MySQL last class: we'll work on getting everything sorted out if it isn't already.
        To use MySQL in Node is to increase the robustness of back-end applications by several magnitudes. If you cannot get connected during
        this class, it is imperative that you follow along with a working installation.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Creating a Database Connection</h1>
      <p>Just like in regular SQL, MySQL in Node is extremely&mdash;almost annoyingly&mdash;particular about its syntax, which means it will
        crash if it finds something not right. If you had problems during the previous class, we can get you caught up and get those errors fixed.
      </p>
      <p>I'm going to demonstrate how to connect to our MySQL database using the <span class="mono">mysql</span> plugin for Node.</p>
      <div class="activity">
        <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
        <p>For the following example, I'm going to have to install the MySQL package via NPM.
          I'll also be using the <span class="mono">dotenv</span> package, which I'll explain. Then,
          we'll do the following:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">var mysql = require("mysql");

var connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 3306,

  // Username
  user: process.env.USER,

  // Password
  password: process.env.PASSWORD,
  database: 'ice_creamDB' // DB we want to connect to
});</code></pre>
        <p>Now that have all of our credentials set up, let's try establishing a connection:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">connection.connect((err) => {
  if(err) throw err;
  console.log(`connected as id ${connection.threadId}`);
});</code></pre>
        <p>Without further ado, let's run it!</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <p>We are going to be working on creating an application that takes in music data to create personalized
        playlists. Make sure to get as far as you can over the course of these assignments, as the coding you do here will be extremely useful
        to you when you begin working on the homework.
        </p>
        <p>For now, we will simply be creating your database in MySQL and then creating a connection to said database using Node.</p>
        <p class="note">Remember,
        you must create a database before attempting to connect to it. Doing otherwise will return an error.</p>
        <p><span class="bonus">Bonus:</span> Using MySQL Workbench, create a table in your database with four columns:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Primary Key of <span class="mono">ID</span> which auto-increments</li>
          <li>A column called <span class="mono">title</span></li>
          <li>A column called <span class="mono">artist</span></li>
          <li>A column called <span class="mono">genre</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="bonus">Bonus:</span> Using MySQL Workbench, populate your table with a few rows of dummy data.</p>
        <p><span class="bonus">Bonus:</span> Start looking into how you can use the MySQL package to read data from a MySQL database.</p>
      </div>
      <p>This is all well and good, but how do we get records from a MySQL database using Node?
        This thing is not very useful without the ability to grab or insert data. Which brings us to
        our next section...
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Fetching MySQL Data Via Node</h1>
      <p>Let's look at that initial example I showed you earlier. As we've seen before,
        making a connection is not terribly difficult. So long as you understand SQL syntax,
        the Node commands will come naturally to you. The MySQL package just so happens to use
        an extrememly similar, if not identical syntax as SQL in its usage.
      </p>
      <p>In order to demonstrate this, within <code class="language-javascript">connection.connect(...)</code>
        I'm going to insert the following code snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">connection.query("SELECT * FROM products", (err, res) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(res);
});</code></pre>
      <hr>
      <p>Through calling <code class="language-javascript">connection.query(&lt;STRING>,(err, res) => {})</code>,
        we are telling Node to send an SQL query to our database and return the data collected through
  the <span class="mono">res</span> variable.</p>
      <p>That <code class="language-javascript">&lt;STRING></code> portion uses SQL syntax and should be contained
        within a pair of quotes. Because of this, you must be very careful with your syntax&mdash;even
        small differences could lead to an error being returned. Any query can be run within
      that field, allowing you to collect specific types of data as well.</p>
      <p>Notice that we run the query inside of the body of the <code class="language-javascript">connect</code> method's callback function.
        Since the <code class="language-javascript">connection.connect</code> and <code class="language-javascript">connection.query</code>
      methods both run asynchronously, there's no guarantee that the <code class="language-javascript">connection.query</code>
      method will run after <code class="language-javascript">connect</code> if it's
      run from outside. If we didn't want to put the entire query method inside of the callback, we could also wrap the query method
      inside of a function. For example:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">connection.connect((err) => {
if (err) throw err;
  console.log("connected as id " + connection.threadId);
  selectAll();
});

var selectAll = () => {
  connection.query("SELECT * FROM products", (err, res) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(res);
  });
}</code></pre>
      <p>Asynchrony is likely to give you issues in the cutues. With callbacks, we can mitigate
        the issues from things such as <span class="note">race conditions</span>, wherein the order in which two
        or more tasks run is nondeterministic. This is bad. Let's run the above code, which does
        not have this issue, then parse through the response. For reference, <span class="mono">res</span>
        is a local variable here.

        <h3>Collecting Data From a Database</h3>
        <p>Using the connection and song data you put together earlier into the class, we are going to print playlists to the Git Bash
        console based upon the genre or artist.</p>
        <p>First, create code that prints all songs within your database to the terminal.</p>
        <p>Then, create code that prints songs of a specific genre/artist to the terminal.</p>
        <p>If you don't have many songs in your database at this point in time, take this moment to add some more to it. Try to give
        yourself a variety of songs to work with.</p>
        <p><span class="hint">Hint:</span> Remember that you can call specific data using SQL commands we went over last class. If you are having trouble, make sure
        to look into SQL commands once more.</p>
        <p><span class="Bonus">Bonus:</span> Use ES6 template strings or string concatenation to build a MySQL query which allows you to change pieces of the query
        on the fly (e.g. using a variable to build the <code>where</code> clause, instead of a static string).</p>

        <h2>Collecting Data From a Database Review</h2>
        <p>Let's go over what we need to do to get this working.</p>

    <section>
      <h1>CRUD</h1>
      <p>When using a database, a common application programming paradigm is that of
        <abbr class="note" title="Create Read Update Delete">CRUD</abbr> (Create Read Update Delete).
        We can visualize this like the following:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-sql">--CREATE
  insert into pets (name, type, age) values ("Scooby Doo", "dog", 3);
--READ
  select * from pets;
--UPDATE
  update pets set name="Courage" where type = "dog";
--DELETE
  delete from pets where type = "mouse";</code></pre>

    <p>I'm going to update my own ice cream database using a JS file full of queries, going

  <div class="student-activity">
    <h2>Student activity!</h2>
    <h3>CRUD and Playlists</h3>
    <p>It's time to start making our playlist application a little more functional through including all four C.R.U.D elements within
    it.</p>
    <p>Add in some pieces of code that CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE specific pieces of data from your MySQL database. Make sure to
    include a READ statement at the end as well to ensure that the changes you are making are working properly.</p>
    <p><span class="bonus">Bonus:</span> After successfully adding CRUD to your application, it's time to test your mettle and see if you can make it so this app
    is more dynamic. Add the ability for users to dynamically input their own data into the database using the Inquirer NPM package.</p>
    <p><span class="hint">Hint:</span> Recall that you can create MySQL queries which include variables using question marks. Proper usage of this will help you
    quite a bit.</p>
    <p><span class="hint">Hint:</span> Remember to take into account the scope of Inquirer package when putting your application together.</p>

      <h1>Break Time!</h1>
    </div>
    <section>
      <h1>Practice Activity</h1>
      <p>We'll be spending the remainder of the class working on a large CRUD-based MySQL and Node activity.
        This should be done in groups of three or four, so get into groups while I begin to talk about the activity.
      </p>
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Group activity!</h2>
        <h3>Great-Bay</h3>
        <p>Within your groups you are going to be creating a Node application called "Great-Bay" which allows users to create and bid
        on assorted items, tasks, jobs, or projects.</p>
        <p>The basic application is fairly simple: Upon loading up the program, the user is prompted on whether they would like to "POST
        AN ITEM" or "BID ON AN ITEM"</p>
        <p>If the user selects "POST AN ITEM" they are prompted for an assortment of information regarding the item and then that information
        is added to the database so that others can bid on it</p>
        <p>If the user selects "BID ON AN ITEM" they are shown a list of all available items and then are prompted to select what they
        would like to bid on. The console then asks them how much they would like to bid, and their bid is compared to the previous
        highest bid. If their bid is higher, inform the user of their success and replace the previous bid with the new one. If their
        bid is lower (or equal), inform the user of their failure and boot them back to the selection screen.</p>
        <p>Once your group has put together the basic application, it's time to test your collective skills on some additional functionality,
        or "addons". Remember to take into consideration the amount of time you have been given when choosing what addons you would
        like to tackle.</p>
        <p>Create a sign up and login system that prompts users for a username and password upon loading up the app. <span class="bold">Do not worry
        about setting up a truly secure database if you choose to tackle this addon. Just worry about building working sign up and
        login features.</span></p>
        <p>Create a system on the "POST AN ITEM" which allows users to look at the auctions they have created. On this screen they can
        add new auctions, modify previous auctions, or close bidding on an auction.</p>
        <p>Create a system which allows users to view all of the auctions of which they are the leading bidder.</p>
        <p>Create a third option on the main screen which allows administrators to modify the database as they see fit.</p>
        <p>Create visually appealing tables. This means making dynamic console code and it is a lot harder than it might seem at first
          so do not think this one is so simple.</p>
        <p>Create a search function that allows users to look through the database of available auctions to find those that share the
          specified keyword or username.</p>
        <p>Get creative! There are a lot of addons to this app which you could create so feel free to work with your group to come up
          with something not listed above!</p>
