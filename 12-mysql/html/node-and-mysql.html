      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Hello, everyone! Last time, despite some major hiccups we were able to declare databases, tables in that database,
        columns in those tables, and data in rows in those tables. All of this is great for data storage, manipulation,
        and retrieval. However, it's not very useful in a bubble&mdash;today, we'll be using Node to connect to your
        local MySQL server. After connecting to it, we'll be able to do all of the same commands as we can in a GUI-based
        SQL management software, or directly via the CLI.</p>
      <p>For those of you who had issues with installing MySQL last class: we'll work on getting everything sorted out if it isn't already.
        To use MySQL in Node is to increase the robustness of back-end applications by several magnitudes. If you cannot get connected during
        this class, it is imperative that you follow along with a working installation.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Creating a Database Connection</h1>
      <p>Just like in regular SQL, MySQL in Node is extremely&mdash;almost annoyingly&mdash;particular about its syntax, which means it will
        crash if it finds something not right. If you had problems during the previous class, we can get you caught up and get those errors fixed.
      </p>
      <p>I'm going to demonstrate how to connect to our MySQL database using the <span class="mono">mysql</span> plugin for Node.</p>
