        <h1>Administrivia</h1>
        <p>Good morning, everyone! Last time, the last activity we did required the use of <abbr class="accent" title="Node Package Manager">NPM</abbr>&mdash;today,
          we'll be going over exactly what it is, what NPM packages are, why they're useful, and the <code>package.json</code>.
          This class is critical for your ability to complete the homework due next week, as well as for
          your broader proficiency as Node developers.</p>
        <p>Questions, comments, concerns before we begin?</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Quick Review</h1>
        <p>We'll begin by doing a couple of quick refresher activities.</p>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <h3>CommandSort Refresher</h3>
          <p>Starting from a blank file, create a Node-based command-line application that takes in a series of numbers from the user and returns the numbers sorted
          in ascending order.</p>
          <p><span class="note">Note:</span> feel free to google how to sort integers numerically. This should
          just be a single method.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="review">
          <h2>CommandSort Review</h2>
          <p>This activity required using <code>process.argv</code>, taking out the non-filename arguments
          and pushing them into an array, then sorting them using <code>.sort</code>.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <h3>Request Refresher</h3>
          <p>Let's take a look again at an app that makes requests to the OMDb api.</p>
          <p>We'll go quickly over the code and make sure everyone is comfortable with making
            HTTP requests from Node. When I demo it, what do I need to make sure I do before running it?</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>A Proper Intro to NPM</h1>
        <p>Previously, we used NPM to install the <code>request</code> package. <span class="note">NPM</span>,
        or <span class="note">Node Package Manager</span> allows us to quickly incorporate pre-made code snippets into our Node applications.
        Let's take a look at the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/browse/star">NPM site</a> and how it lists available
        Node packages for inclusion. We can look up NPM packages for <span class="monospace bold">request</span>, Twitter and Spotify, among
        many, <span class='italic'>many</span> others that will be unfamiliar at first, like <span class="monospace bold">dotenv</span>.
        </p>
        <p>NPM gives us a massive arsenal of libraries and objects that we can leverage
          to greatly increase the efficiency in which we develop Node applications.
        </p>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <p>As an example, let's search for a package called <span class="monospace bold">weather-js</span>.</p>
          <p>Using the NPM site, we can get syntax, usage, and other documentation on how to use it.
            We'll want to use this package to get weather reports.
          </p>
          <p>Next, let's briefly skim the code for an application that uses this package, then try to run it.</p>
          <p>After running it, we'll take a more in-depth look at the code, paying special attention to
            <code>weather.find</code> and <code>JSON.stringify</code>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <p>Now that you've had a chance to take a look at using an NPM package, let's get some questions
          before you attempt to tackle an application that uses a different package.
        </p>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <h3>Geocode NPM</h3>
          <p>I'll be demoing an application that takes either cities or landmarks then returns
            a JSON object that geocodes the location. This is incredibly useful for map-based applications!
          </p>
          <p>Create a Node application which makes use of the <span class="monospace bold">geocoder</span> NPM package to obtain detailed geocoding information about a
          location. Then, log the geocoding information to your terminal.</p>
          <p>You can choose to make one of two assumptions when completing this application:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="note">Easier Option:</span> The user will always provide a location in the following format: "City, State"
              <span class="italic">(ex. "Atlanta, GA", "Houston, TX")</span>.</li>
            <li><span class="note">Harder Option:</span> The user can provide a location in any format. In fact, they can even provide a landmark instead of an address.
              <span class="italic">("151 Sip Ave, Jersey City NJ", "The Eiffel Tower", etc.)</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Remember to log the output using <code>JSON.stringify</code> in a pretty-print format.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="review">
          <h2>Geocode NPM Review</h2>
          <p>For this activity, we need the <span class="monospace bold">geocoder</span> NPM package and <code>process.argv</code>
          for command-line arguments.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the code!</code></p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Partner activity!</h2>
          <h3 class="monospace">weatherDest.js</h3>
          <p>Take a moment to run the <code>weatherDest.js</code> application.
            Try to figure out what it takes to run on your own. You will need two different NPM packages for this.</p>
          <p>Then, with a partner, spend a few moments answering the following questions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What does the code do?</li>
            <li>How does it work at a general level?</li>
            <li>How does it work at a line level?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="review">
          <h2><span class="monospace">weatherDest.js</span> Review</h2>
          <p>We're going to take a moment for you to explain the code as well as its purpose.</p>
          <p>Then, we'll run it with an input using <code>node weatherDest.js [location]</code>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Node applications generally have much more than just a handful of packages. We may need
          dozens at a time, each of which increases the robustness and complexity of the application while simultaneously
          increasing the overall size.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Package Management</h1>
        <p>The addition of a package to an application increases its filesize, sometimes by an extremely large amount.
          Since the filesize of the application tends to balloon extremely quickly and easily, portability comes into question.
          This is especially relevant regarding collaboration&mdash;even moreso than deployment.
          The question is phrased thusly:
        </p>
        <blockquote>Why might zipping up code containing NPM packages and sending it around be a bad approach for a collaborative team?</blockquote>
        <hr>
        <h2>Life Without Package Management</h2>
        <p>There are three key issues we face:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Each large NPM dependency would have to bundled in every time the code is shared&mdash;
            this is perhaps the most obvious answer.
          </li>
          <li>If one developer updates the package to use a more recent version, then everyone else's code goes out of sync, requiring a
          transfer of files again.</li>
          <li>There is no clear and easy way to know which dependencies are being used. If we had many files with each using different
          dependencies, we'd need to dig into each and every file to figure out the full list.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Luckily for us, we already have a way to keep track of our dependencies!</p>
        <h2>The <span class="monospace">package.json</span></h2>
        <p>The <code>package.json</code> is an incredibly important topic as well as an extremely convenient solution for keeping 
        track of dependencies. It's just a file Node reads for installation and updates whenever a new package is added or removed.
        They serve as manifests&mdash;or guides&mdash;that completely articulate simple things like the name of the project, its description, and most importantly the packages
        that are being used in the project. Speaking of convenient, <code>npm</code> has a command for writing a new
        package.json using a simple set of text-based options.</p>
