        <h1>Administrivia</h1>
        <p>Welcome back from project week! Today's class will entail learning a technology
        many of you have heard of. For the uninitiated, our discussion on Node might be totally mind-blowing. You'll
        get firsthand experience with a cutting edge technology that is practically ubiquitous in the industry&mdash;knowledge
        of this tech is practically your golden ticket.</p>
        <p>As for addressing the redesign for your instructor notes, I personally felt that the dark-on-light text was hard
          on the eyes. It also makes sense to change up the notes for a completely different focus for the latter half of the
          class. You're already golden when it comes to front-end development on the client side, so all the way through November we'll be focusing
          mainly on server-side development, getting to the heart of what makes some really cool tech tick.</p>
        <p class="accent">Let's get to work!</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Servers and Clients</h1>
        <p>When we think of <span class='italic'>full-stack development</span>, what do we mean? We use full-stack to refer to both the front-end&mdash;i.e. client-side&mdash;and back-end&mdash;server-side. Up to this point,
        everything we've written has been client-side, as all the code written is compiled and run on
        the machine an application runs on. Your browser fetches the necessary files from the webserver, or back-end,
        then renders everything and executes the necessary script(s). With the exception of Firebase&mdash;a back-end
        technology&mdash;only front-end technologies have been used thus far.</p>

        <p><span class="note">Servers</span> take requests from <span class="note">clients</span>, returning what they ask
          for in responses. When your browser navigates to any page, it makes a series of requests like <span class="italic">"What's in this file?"
          "Can I get the images, stylesheets and fonts for this?" "What are the contents of this JavaScript file I want?"</span></p>
        <p>Servers can be physical computers, proper enterprise grade tech with absurd specs, virtual machines; pretty much anything.
        Your own machines can serve requests too. More often, however, they're clients: you direct your browser to a site, it asks
          the server with HTTP(S) requests for stuff, the server processes the requests, gives back the files you asked for to the browser <span class="italic gray">(provided they
          don't 404 or worse, the dreaded 500 error)</span>,
          the browser renders the HTML and runs client-side JavaScript.</p>
        <blockquote class="note">Here's a thought: what about server-side JavaScript?</blockquote>

        <h1>Intro to Node.js</h1>
        <div class="flex-vert">
          <img src="https://nodejs.org/static/images/logos/nodejs-new-white.png" alt="Node.js logo" style="width:50%" />
          <small class="italic gray">(Time for Node! Finally!)</small>
        </div>
        <p>Enter <span class="bold accent">Node.js</span>. Node is a technology that allows us to write JavaScript
        code and execute it on the server side. Before 2009, we'd likely still be using a completely different
        server-side language, like PHP. Node makes it such that a different language isn't even necessary
        for the back-end. This is incredibly convenient vis-&#x00E1;-vis front-end JavaScript developers
        not needing to learn a new language to develop on the back-end.</p>
        <h2>Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Threading</h2>
        <p>We're going to get into some pretty technical stuff next, with a lot of jargon. Please feel free to slow me down and ask
          an abundance of questions. We'll begin by just going to the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/about/" target="_blank">
            Node.js "About" page</a>.</p>
            <p>One of the immediate advantages we have in Node is that synchronous threading, which is the
              traditional method of handling requests, has to make a new thread for each and every request, taking
              care of them in order and one at a time. For hundreds of requests, that's a lot of threads and a lot of waiting.
              In contrast, Node is <span class="note">single-threaded and asynchronous</span>&mdash;we already know what
              asynchronous means, and single-threaded implies that a Node server only has one thread. What this means is that
              requests not being taken care of are put in the background (like putting them on ice) and eventually resolved with a callback.
              Yes, that kind of callback!</p>
              <p>What we get here is a tremendous boost in efficiency under heavy load: less resources, less time, more requests taken care of.</p>
              <small class='italic muted'>&mdash;Don't worry if this is going over your head. It's hard to visualize.&mdash;</small>

        <h1>Practice With Node</h1>
        <p>We've gone over some of the complexities and advantages of Node, so let's get our hands dirty next. You'll
        finally be able to put the <code>node</code> command in your terminals to good use. I mean, like, a <span class="italic">lot</span>
        of use.</p>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Verify that you can crack open a terminal and run <code>node</code> with no arguments. When you get a greater-than sign <code>&gt;</code>
            start typing in some javascript, like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>true === false</code></li>
            <li><code>42*13</code></li>
            <li><code>let foo = 'foo'</code></li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>It's just a JavaScript console without the <code>window</code> object and some other browser-based objects. Note that <code>console.log</code>
          still works!</p>
        <p>So, without a window, how do we run JavaScript on the backend? It's actually very intuitive, and works very similarly to other
          server side languages&mdash;PHP and Ruby use this same exact methodology.</p>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <p>Follow along as I show you how to execute a JavaScript file on the backend.</p>
          <p>I'm going to create a new file, fill it with some basic output stuff, and run it with <code>node</code>.</p>
          <p>As a general note, there does exist Node-specific syntax not present in vanilla client-side JS. We'll get into that later.
          Being able to run JavaScript outside of a browser is a huge deal as it is, get hype!</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h3>Think you can do this yourself?<br>Questions, comments, concerns, musings, ideas?</h3>
        <p>You'll be doing something similar in a bit, so please ask away. Let's talk about how cool this is.</p>
        <hr>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Create a new file called <code>sriracha.js</code> somewhere easily accessible via your terminal.</p>
          <p>Inside the file use JavaScript to log the words: <span class="bright-accent"><br>"Sriracha. Goes great on... everything!"</span>
            or<br><span class="bright-accent">"Sriracha. Goes great on... nothing"</span>. You choose.</p>
            <small class="italic muted">(I happen to love the stuff. Your Slacked-out instructions will have a different opinion.)</small>
          <p>Then, run the program using Node in your terminal/bash window. Confirm that it logged the text as you would expect.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h2>The <span class="italic monospace">process</span> Object</h2>
        <p>Much like in a browser, Node gives us some objects to help us peer behind the curtain and see what's going on.</p>
        <p><code>process</code> gives us access to myriad objects for data and functionality, including environment variables, the ability
          to change directories while the code is executing, process management, command line input, and many, many more. Right now, we're going
          to be interested in <code>process.argv</code>.</p>
        <p>What this gives us is our own command-line arguments. Much like <code>cd</code>, <code>mv</code>, every <code>git</code> command, etc.,
          we can run Node with arguments and use them.</p>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <p>Reading your arguments is as easy as the following: <code>console.log(process.argv)</code></p>
          <p>Let's do a quick example with this and see what the contents are.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Let's play with argument addition, paying special attention
            to types.</p>
          <p>First, we'll try <code>process.argv[2] + process.argv[3]</code>, then the same thing
            using <code>parseFloat()</code>.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Partner activity!</h2>
          <p>Create a command line Node application that takes in two parameters and outputs whether
            they are equal or not.</p>
          <p><span class="hint">Hint:</span> start by simply logging the value of each argument to
            console. Then use your usual JavaScript approach (recall that Node is still just JavaScript).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="review">
          <h2>Parameter Check Activity Review</h2>
          <p>The quickest way to do this is as follows:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(process.argv[2] === process.argv[3]);</code></pre>
          <p>The less efficient, easier way:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">let a = process.argv[2];
let b = process.argv[3];

if (a === b){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}</code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>Getting the hang of it? Let's play some more with command line arguments.</p>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Create a command-line node application that takes in parameters like this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>node calculator.js add 1 2</code> ... and outputs 3</li>
            <li><code>node calculator.js subtract 5 2</code> ... and outputs 3</li>
            <li><code>node calculator.js multiply 3 2</code> ... and outputs 6</li>
            <li><code>node calculator.js divide 8 2</code> ... and outputs 4</li>
            <li><code>node calculator.js remainder 7 2</code> ... and outputs 1</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In summary: implement add, subtract, multiply, divide and remainder operations on
            input arguments.</p>
          <p><span class="bonus">Bonus:</span> enable your calculator application to also handle the below cases:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>node calculator.js exp 7 2</code> ... and output 49 (7 squared)</li>
            <li><code>node calculator.js algebra 4x+2=10</code> ... and output 2</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="italic muted">(<span class="hint">Hint:</span> assume the algebra will always be in this exact form
            and will always be addition)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="review">

        <h1>Modularization: Require and Exports</h1>
        <p>One of Node's greatest strengths is its ability to include objects, libraries and packages. Think about
        how you include a library on the client side using <code>&lt;script></code> tags&mdash;Node works differently.
        The object <code>module.exports</code> allows us to use objects, functions and variables from elsewhere, allowing us
        to use <code>require("./food.js")</code> to get a file called "food.js" in the same directory.</p>
        <p>Say we wanted an array from "food.js". We can export an array <code>food</code> as follows:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">var food = [
  "spam",
  "ham",
  "eggs"
];

module.exports = {
  food: food
}</code></pre>
      <p>When we want to use that <code>food</code> array, we use <code>require("./food.js")</code> and we've got it!</p>
      <div class="activity">
        <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
        <p>Let's do a live example of modularization, using <code>module.exports</code>,
          an external file <code>ess.js</code>, and a main file <code>run.js</code>.</p>
        <p>We'll be paying particularly close attention to what actually gets stored in
          the exported object, and what gets ignored.</p>
