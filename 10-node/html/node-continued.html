        <h1>Administrivia</h1>
        <p>Hello, everyone! Welcome to day two of our discussion on Node. Today's lesson will be mainly
          activity-focused as we continue past the "Hello, world"&ndash;style activities we did on Monday.
        </p>
        <p>Let's get some questions, comments, and/or concerns before we begin.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Quick Practice</h1>
        <p>We'll be getting started with some very simple review from last time using command line 
          arguments. Remember how to use <code>process.argv</code>, the argument order and the main "gotcha"
          for command-line input. For this specific activity, it won't really matter too much, but recall
          that input from <code>STDIN</code> is always treated as a set of strings delimited by spaces.</p>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Here's an easy one to start with. Starting from a blank JavaScript file, create a Node application that takes in two
            command line arguments and checks if they are equal. If the two numbers are equal then output: "true". Otherwise, output: "false".</p>
          <p><span class="bonus">Bonus:</span> Check if the two numbers are both multiples of 7. Again output "true" if they are and output
            "false" if they are not. <span class="italic">(Be wary of your types.)</span></p>
          <p><span class="hint">Hint:</span> <code>console.log(process.argv)</code> as a starting point if you are completely lost.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="review">
          <h2>Command Line Equality Review</h2>
          <p>Let's go over this activity real quick. There's the easy way and less obvious-looking refactored
            version.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>File I/O</h1>
        <p>One of the advantages of server-side languages is access to <span class="bold accent">file manipulation</span>,
          which is normally made impossible on the client side. Your machine is, by design, hard-wired to disallow
          file operations outside of the browser&mdash;i.e. the cache, localStorage, etc.
          Files can't be read or written on the client side, as doing so would be hilariously
          disastrous.</p>
        <p>On the server side, what's stopping us from keeping a JSON file around for storage? A file with
          Node instructions? What if we want to just write a file with the output from an API call? Absolutely
          nothing. In fact, it's a great skill to know! Let's dive into writing files on the back-end.</p>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <p>I'm going to show you how to write to a text file using Node's internal <code>fs</code>
          (file system) package.</p>
          <p>I'll run some code first, then we'll talk about what's going on here.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h3>So, if the Node method for writing files is <span class="monospace accent">writeFile</span>, what could the Node method
          for reading files be?</h3>
        <hr>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
          <p>Let's check out a demo with <code>readFile</code>. Notice how the directory I'll be working in has
            both a <code>read.js</code> file and a <code>movies.txt</code> file within it.
          </p>
          <p>Then, we'll see how it works by stepping through the code.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h2>Discovering New Methods</h2>
        <p>Let's discuss the process of "discovering" methods like <code>readFile</code> and <code>writeFile</code>.
          Our process depends very heavily on API documentation, as it always does&mdash;maybe we google implementation if
          the docs aren't up to snuff, or if overcomplexity hinders our understanding.<span class="star"></span></p>
        <small><span class="star"></span><span class="muted italic">This happens more often than
          I'd like, personally. Stack Overflow is great if you remain wary of old answers. That's important to note. It can make or
          break a solution, culminating in browser incompatibilities, unnecessarily complicated answers, and/or deprecated
          functionality.</span></small>
        <p>Let's check out the <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html" target="_blank" alt="Node Documentation For fs">
          Node API <span class="monospace">fs</span> documentation</a>. Feel free to follow along with me as we explore
          the list of methods we're provided with. We'll focus on methods we're now familiar with.</p>
        <hr>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Partner activity!</h2>
          <h3>Best Things Ever</h3>
          <p>Create a Node application that reads the <code>best_things_ever.txt</code> file, parses the comma separated elements, and ultimately
            console logs each element in the file on separate lines.</p>
          <p><span class="hint">Hint:</span> If you are struggling to figure out how to loop your way through the text, look into the
            <code>.split()</code> method. This could make your life a whole lot easier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="review">
          <h2>Best Things Ever Review</h2>
          <p>We'll be going over the solution now.</p>
          <p>Note how we use <code>data.split(',')</code>
            to separate the elements by commas and push them into an array. This comma is called our <span class="note">delimiter.</p>
            We then loop through the given array and log each element.</div>
        </div>

        <h1>Break Time!</h1>

      <section>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <h3>bank.js</h3>
          <p>Starting from scratch, build a Node application called <code>bank.js</code> which takes in user input via the command
          line to register bank transactions. The transactions possible are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>total</code> &mdash; this should tally up all of the money in the bank balance and display it for the user.</li>
            <li><code>deposit</code> &mdash; this should add a positive amount to the bank balance.
              <span class="italic">(No need to display the total here)</span></li>
            <li><code>withdraw</code> &mdash; this should add a negative amount to the bank balance.
            <span class="italic">(Again, no need to display the total here)</span>
            <li><code>lotto</code> &mdash; this should subtract an amount from the bank balance, but if a random number is hit it
            should add back a larger amount into the bank balance.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For all deposits, withdrawals, or lotto purchases the transaction should be registered in the <code>bank.txt</code> file.</p>
          <p><span class="hint">Hint:</span> consider making a series of switch-case statements to identify the "type" of transaction
            and the "amount" involved (if relevant).</p>
          <p><span class="bonus">Bonus:</span> If you finish early, consider finding creative ways to expand the functionality.
            Perhaps add a login, perhaps always provide the total, perhaps add a warning if the user tries to withdraw more than they hold, etc.</p>
