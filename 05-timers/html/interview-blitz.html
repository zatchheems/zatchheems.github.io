        <h1>Administrivia</h1>
        <p>Any questions or anything unclear from our last class?</p>
        <h2>Homework</h2>
        <p>Let's talk about and demo your next assignment: a JavaScript trivia app
          that uses timing functions.</p>
        <h2>Today's class</h2>
        <p>We've been following a different format from our usual lessons the last few days;
        today is going to be a completely different format before we move on to our next unit.</p>
        <p>Today, you'll be working on activities based on the kinds of questions you may encounter
          in job interview for developer positions.</p>
      </section>

        <h1></h1>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <h3>Practice Visualizing Problems</h3>
          <p>Find a partner you don't usually work with and answer this question:</p>
          <blockquote>In U.S. supermarkets, what is the highest selling product?</blockquote>
          <p>You can't just come up with a random item&mdash;you will likely be flat-out wrong.
            No Googling, either! Instead, imagine that a potential job is at stake. This may seem
            silly, but visualizing problems is key to answering more of these types of questions.</p>
          <p>Try visualizing yourself walking past the doors to get into a supermarket: if you
            were making a weekly trip, which item near the entrance would you gravitate toward?
            Remember that the produce section is often the first thing you'll see in a supermarket.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Class activity</h2>
          <p>Let's pool our answers together in the same document.</p>
          <p>First, let's get answers from five pairs and list them on screen. How did
          you get your solution?</p>
          <p>Think about the cheapest thing in the produce section, and the easiest thing to eat.</p>
          <p>This is the thought process your interviewer will likely care the most about.
            Even if you didn't answer correctly, it's more important that you <span class="bold">visualized</span>
            the problem and responded with something close or at least informed.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class="line-break">
        <h2>Why are we talking about <span class="italic">bananas?</span></h2>
        <p>Job candidates in all fields often encounter <span class="note">conceptual problems</span>,
          questions with no certain means to find answers. Your only recourse is to think high-level and
          visualize a solution. If you conceive the situation, you'll tend to find a close answer.
          You must visualize the problem, provide your solution and explain your thought process
          if you want to impress your interviewers.</p>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Solve this next problem with the same partner from the last activity:</p>
          <p>I give you an array of 51 cards. Each card contains two properties: the suit,
            and the title (a string of either a number or a ranking: king, ace, so on).</p>
          <p>Fifty-two cards form a deck, but I gave you 51. One is missing! How do you find it?</p>
          <p>Try to come up with the most efficient steps to solve this.</p>
          <p><span class="note">Hint:</span> Using a for loop against an array of values is not
            the most efficient solution&mdash;what if the cards aren't sorted?</p>
          <p>Visualize this problem and try to think up a solution in steps; write those steps out.
            You can even write a JavaScript solution if you have enough time.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class="line-break">
        <h2>Solution Process</h2>
        <p>Let's go over a few of your pseudocoded solutions.</p>
        <p>What was your thought process like?</p>
        <hr class="line-break">
        <p>We won't be discussing an actual solution to this problem&mdash;this activity
          is about spurring you to problem solve. That's more important than coming up
          with a real answer.</p>
        <p>This is another type of interview question that you should anticipate.
          The interviewer won't even care about finding a "real" solution&mdash;maybe there isn't one!
          They just want to measure your aptitude for thinking about the problems you'll encounter
          during work:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Will you consider the whole issue before trying to find a solution,
            or will you rush into the problem and come up with a flimsy response?</li>
          <li>If you encounter a major snag on one path to a possible solution, will you: give up,
            stay on the same doubtful train of thought, or think about what other possible
            answers might exist?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is why it's important to nail down visualization to conceptualize your problems.</p>
        <h2>The Interview Process</h2>
        <p>Let's get right down to the process itself.</p>
        <p>What's the actual process like? How many rounds of interviews are there?
          Will they be behavioral? Technical?</p>
        <p>We'll share some relevant experiences and advice, and maybe a couple of things
          that are vital to know beforehand.</p>
        <p>After talking about the process, the rest of the class will be devoted to exercises based on
          the kind of questions you might expect in a technical interview.</p>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <h3>FizzBuzz</h3>
          <p>FizzBuzz is a classic programming activity; it's commonly used to test
            basic knowledge in almost any programming language, whether that's JavaScript,
            Java, C, Python, PHP, etc. We'll be (obviously) doing this one in JS.</p>
          <p>For this activity, you must write a script that cycles through a series of
            numbers and prints them out. In this case, we'll be looping from 1 to 100, outputting the numbers
            to the console. There are a few caveats:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If the number is a multiple of three, the program will print <span class="bold class">Fizz</span> instead of the number.</li>
            <li>Likewise, if the number is a multiple of five, the program will print <span class="bold id">Buzz</span>.</li>
            <li>If a number is a multiple of both three and five, then the script will spit out <span class="bold class">Fizz</span><span class="bold id">Buzz</span>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Be sure to pseudocode it out, first: don't start coding until you've thought
            about how to accomplish this task at a high-level. It might seem unnecessary for this activity,
            but interviewers will expect you to think your problems out at a high level before coding a solution.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class="line-break">
        <h2>Going over FizzBuzz</h2>
        <p>Let's get someone's solution via Slack. We'll run it and test it out, and debug it
          if there are any issues.</p>
        <p>Didn't do it the same way? Let's try someone else's solution and see how it differs.
          Chances are, solutions will vary&mdash;remember that there can be hundreds of ways
          to answer a problem.</p>
        <p>Still, be mindful of how you tackle a problem, though&mdash;if your potential code
          lacks elegance or repeats itself when <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself" class="note">DRY</abbr>
          is possible, you might want to think a bit longer to come up with another solution.</p>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <h3>Prime Checker</h3>
          <p>This assignment will be much more challenging than the last two. Spend at least five minutes
          away from any code to pseudocode your work.</p>
          <p>Write a function that checks to see if a number is a prime number or not.
            Have it return <code class='value'>true</code> if it is, or <code class="id">false</code> if it's not.
          <p>Feel free to Google what constitutes prime numbers. (That's not really the focus of the activity.)</p>
        </div>
        <hr class="line-break">
        <h2>Going Over Prime Checker</h2>
        <p>Let's get someone's pseudocoding process for this exercise. How long did you spend on pseudocode?
          What properties of the prime number did you base your code around?</p>
        <p>Let's get someone else's code, line by line, and break it down live.</p>

        <h1>Welcome Back!</h1>
        <p>How are we feeling about the activities thus far? Any more questions about the
          interview process? Types of questions asked? General comments are cool too.</p>

        <h1>Algorithms, In Brief</h1>
        <p>The final activity we'll be doing in class is a common demo of a classic (infamous!)
          computer algorithm: <span class='bold id'>bubble sort</span>.</p>
        <p>But first, what is a computer algorithm?</p>
        <p>Easy! It's just a set of steps for a computer to solve a particular problem. They are usually written with both
          temporal and spatial efficiency in mind, but some (like bubble sort) are not really interested in that,
          and seek to solve problems quick 'n' dirty.</p>
        <h2>So, how does an algorithm differ from a program?</h2>
        <p>While some programs comprise a series of steps, a developer must code them out in a particular language.
          Algorithms are more high level&mdash;developers can apply the steps of an algorithm to
          different programs in order to solve various problems, like sorting and searching through data.</p>
        <p>Bubble sort in particular is an inefficient, slow algorithm for sorting data: it's fine for small
          amounts of data. You will probably say "Oh, this is fine! It's pretty quick." However,
          its <span class="note">runtime complexity</span> is abysmal: toss
          thousands of elements at it to sort and its slowness starts to show.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, it's important to know how this algorithm works&mdash;otherwise, how would you avoid it?
          That's why your last interview activity will be to make a program that uses this algorithm.</p>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <h3>Bubble Sort</h3>
          <p>Check out <code>12-bubble_sort</code>. Make sure you spend at least 10min visualizing your
            solution before you code anything. An algorithm is intrinsically high-level, being that it
            can be written in virtually any language; if you don't know how it works, you won't be able
            to solve the problem.</p>
          <hr>
          <p class="italic">No looking at coded-out solutions!</p>
          <p>You're only cheating yourself if you don't get a chance to really work on this.</p>
          <p>The instructions are in the <code>app.js</code> file; the basic overview is to sort a given array
            of numbers in order using bubble sort, and display the array when the
            user clicks the given button in the <code>index.html</code>.</p>
          <p class="note">No jQuery for this assignment! Only vanilla JS is allowed.</p>

      <section>
        <h1>JS/jQuery Checkpoint</h1>
        <p class="note">Checkpoint time!</p>
        <p>Yes, it's that time again: take the multiple-choice
          quiz and answer as best as you can. Remember that this is not graded, doesn't affect your ability
          to complete the course, and is just a way to gauge how you're doing with the material.</p>
