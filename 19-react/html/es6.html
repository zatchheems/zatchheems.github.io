      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Good morning, all! Today's class marks the beginning of something you've all be waiting for:
        <span class="bold">React week</span>! However, we have to rein it in a little to talk about something we've briefly used before:
      ES6. In React, you'll absolutely <span class="italic">need</span> to understand ES6, and not just arrow functions and template strings.
      For this class, you are no longer using ES6 as a suggestion&mdash;it is a requirement. What does this mean for you?</p>
      <p>For starters, it means cleaner, easier-to-read code. Incidentally, this is what can make you stand out as a top contender
        for JavaScript-heavy jobs. Once you start using ES6 (and some ES7 features too!), you'll be primed and ready for React.
      </p>

      <h1>ES5 Warm-Up</h1>
      <p class="no-letter">Today's class begins with an activity to review functional scope. This is a good segue into how we'll be thinking about scope for the
        rest of the class.
      </p>
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>ES5 Warm-Up</h3>
        <p>Check out <span class="mono">101-Stu_ES5Warmup</span>. Go over this file either alone or with a partner and discuss what you
        expect the value to be at each line <span class="italic">without running it in your browser</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="mono">console.log</span> has been replaced with a similar method that logs the line of code for each function call.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="review">
        <h2>ES5 Warm-Up Review</h2>
        <p>Let's take a look at this file and get individual answers to why each stop logs the line it does.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Here's a reminder about the concept of functional scoping: variables are hoisted to the top of and available only in the scope of the containing
      function (or globally, if there exists no containing function). Functional scoping can be confusing, and knowing what the value of a variable is at
      any point can require a significant amount of thought.</p>
      <p>Two big problems with functionally scoped variables:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>You can use variables before their definition, which can lead to unexpected or confusing behavior.</li>
        <li><span class="mono">for</span> loop iterator variables are functionally scoped, which means they can't be specific to a single loop iteration,
        making it harder for things like nested asynchronous functions to use the iterator variable (since that variable will
        be the value of the last iteration of that loop)</li>
      </ol>
      <p><span class="mono">var</span>s are difficult to deal with sometimes, and we don't use them very much in React. Instead,
      we'll use two classic keywords from a while back...</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Const/Let</h1>
      <p>Believe it or not, <span class="mono">const</span> and <span class="mono">let</span> are actually ES6 keywords. These two keywords
      help us declare block-scoped variables such that they are specific to the containing block statement, i.e. anything in curly braces.
    You may have noticed that when I convert examples to ES6, I use <span class="mono">const</span> for required code and <span class="mono">let</span>
    within <code class="language-javascript">for(let i in obj)</code> loops. Why?</p>
    <p>Constants are just that: they remain constant and are unchanging. This is great for included middlewares, numeric and string values.
      <span class="mono">const</span> implicitly tells readers of your code that these values are never going to be reassigned. From here on out,
      you should default to <span class="mono">const</span> unless you're certain that the value is going to change.
    </p>
    <p>In contrast, <span class="mono">let</span> signals clearly to the reader that the variable is likely to be reassigned (especially if you follow default to using
    <span class="mono">const</span> if it won't change). This lets the reader know immediately that this value is going to change. Great care should be
      taken when replacing instances of <span class="mono">var</span> with <span class="mono">let</span>. They do behave differently and can change
      your code's behavior.</p>
    <p>If you recall our fun with scoping from a while ago, you'll recall the value and convenience of block-scoped variables. 
      It's easy to declare variables closer to where they are used in the code, improving readability. Stylistically, you're
      saying "don't use the variable anywhere but right here."

      <h3>Convert Warm-Up ES6 &rarr; ES6 Const/Let</h3>
      <p>Check out <span class="mono">103-Stu_RedoWarmup/Unsolved/function-scoped.js</span>, which is a simplified version of the warmup. Go
      through it and convert all of the variables to be appropriately block-scoped.</p>
      <p>Does the code still work the same way as it did before your refactor?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="review">
      <h2>ES5 &rarr; ES6 Review</h2>
      <p>You should have noticed that the biggest difference in behavior is that
        <span class="mono">setTimeout</span>'s callback function actually prints <span class="mono">i</span>
      as expected. Also, the iterator variable throws reference errors if you try to use it outside of the for loop.</p>

      <h3>Debugging ES5</h3>
      <p>Open up <span class="mono">104-Stu_ES5Debug/Unsolved</span>. Work with a partner to identify and
      resolve an issue in an example using ES5 code. <span class="mono">const</span> and <span class="mono">let</span>
      will be useful here.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="review">
      <h2>Bug squashing!</h2>
      <p>What was the bug? What's the fix?</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Everyone was eating the same number of tacos in the buggy version. If you're anything like me,
        <span class="italic">you're eating much, much more</span> than everyone else. To get proper representation
        for those with voracious appetites, using the loop iterator variable to count the number of tacos each person ate
        is problematic when using <span class="mono">var</span>s instead of block-scoped variables.
      </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Template Literals</h2>
      <p>By now, everyone should be familiar with string template literals. As a refresher:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Boooooring. And tedious, too!
"Hello "+username+".\n\nToday is a boring day to learn ES5."

// This is what we want! No \n or concats
`What's good, ${username}?

Today's a perfect day for some ES6!`

// Another good example
`Your balance is ${balance < 100 ? 'looking kinda low...' : 'a-okay!'}`</code></pre>
    <p>It should be noted that within the template, you can put <span class="note">any</span> valid JavaScript inside.
      When we start React, a very common paradigm is to use conditionally-rendered content, like the above.</p>
    <p>We also have a few convenient methods:
      <span class="mono">startsWith</span>, <span class="mono">endsWith</span>, and
      <span class="mono">includes</span>. These methods are exactly what they say on the tin.</p>
    <div class="student-activity">
      <h2>Student activity!</h2>
      <h3>Template Literals and String methods</h3>
      <p>Crack open <span class="mono">105-Stu_GameOfStrings/Unsolved</span>.</p>
      <p>In this activity, you will convert an application to use string template literals and string methods.</p>
      <p>Convert the <span class="mono">game-of-strings.js</span> into ES6 using what we've learned so far.
      This activity is simply converting the code over to ES6. It isn't necessary to understand every line of code to know
      where improvements can be made. Use <span class="mono">startsWith</span>,
      <span class="mono">endsWith</span>, and <span class="mono">includes</span> where appropriate.</p>
