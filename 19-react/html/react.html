      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Good evening, y'all! This is the lesson you've all been waiting for: React! By beginning this new material,
        we are entering the final frontier of our modern JavaScript material, i.e. front-end frameworks. Today's lesson will
        be gentle, easy, and comfortably-paced so as to not overload you with information all at once. We'll be thinking about
        HTML, CSS and client-side JavaScript much differently than before, so it will help to go slowly as we begin.
      </p>
      <p>Without further ado, let's get into it!</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>What is React?</h1>
      <p>Simply put, <span class="note">React</span> is a front-end JavaScript framework that focuses on interactivity and
      dynamic content whose engine minimizes the amount of re-rendering of components when that content changes. It's loosely
      object-oriented and focuses on breaking a front-end down into <span class="note">components</span>&mdash;each
      component has its own properties and state and is completely standalone. Still with me?</p>
      <h2>Components</h2>
      <p>A component is a self-contained module responsible for producing part of an application's UI and functionality.
        This is radically ifferent from the concept of separating the view and logic layers. When we split up our application into components,
        we're still separating its concerns, but we aren't necessarily separating its technologies.
      </p>
      <p>Example: with Express, Mongo and Handlebars, you provide data to a Handlebars template that renders a chat client.
        In React, you have separate components for the chat view, reaction button, share menu, etc. that all have their own logic and
        take different slices of data.</p>
      <p>This might seem weird at first, but today's class is just a primer, not comprehensive coverage. Let's do some basic
        installation and documentation research.
      </p>
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>Installation + Documentation Research</h3>
        <p>Open up <span class="mono">01-Stu_DocumentationQuestions/README.md</span>. These instructions contain tasks to
        install Create React App and Yarn, then do some research questions based on the React.js documentation.</p>
        <p>The official documentation may seem challenging, but please feel free to visit it again after today's class.</p>
        <p><span class="note">Note:</span> that task seems trivial, but you are urged to take this task seriously; it will
        help you gain a basic sense of what we are trying to accomplish with this new tech.</p>
        <p><span class="note">Note:</span> you may also find it helpful to get the React dev tools plugin for your browser.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="review">
        <h2>Questions Review</h2>
        <p>You'll be given the solved version of the questions shortly; let's go over them aloud.</p>
      </div>
      <p>As a small review: we use components as a way to separate our application into reusable pieces of its UI. This allows us to think about
      each part of our application's interface in isolation and allows us to quickly build new views into our apps over time
      since we'll be able to reuse components we've already created. Using <span class="note">JSX</span> is optional but most React projects make use of it.
      </p>
      <p><span class="note">JSX</span> allows us to describe the UI our components using
      familiar HTML-like markup in our JavaScript. This allows us to quickly describe and understand the UI our components
      will produce as well take advantage of the full power of JavaScript, rather than be limited to the features available
      in a templating language such as Handlebars.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Create React App</h1>
      <p>Now that everyone has <span class="mono">create-react-app</span> installed, let's talk about it and use it. It should
      be noted that this package was not always available: the old way of React installation involved a tedious process involving
      Webpack. Speaking from experience, it was pretty terrible! <span class="mono">create-react-app</span> is as easy as
      running the following:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">create-react-app reactpractice</code></pre>
      <p>What this command does is create the scaffolding for a totally new React application, complete with the name we
        specify. How about running it?
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">yarn start</code></pre>
      <p>And viewing it is as easy as going to <span class="mono">localhost:3000</span>. By default, this command starts our app
        in development mode, i.e. this "mode" is meant for development as our application will
        auto-reload as we make changes to it. Pretty convenient!</p>
      <h2>The SRC Folder</h2>
      <p>The generated boilerplate is interesting: we've got an <span class="mono">src</span> folder automatically processed by Babel,
      then bundled into a single <span class="mono">bundle.js</span> file by Webpack, which is the server React applications run on.
      You can see what the combined <span class="mono">bundle.js</span> file looks like if you were to navigate to
        <span class="mono">
        localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js
      </span> in your browser. This folder is where our React components will live. These files normally produce JSX,
      which corresponds to the web page we have rendered in the browser.</p>
      <p>We have an <span class="mono">index.js</span> file in the <span class="mono">src</span> directory. This is where execution of our React application begins. In this
      way, it is similar to the <span class="mono">server.js</span> file we've been starting all of our node applications with. In order to run any
      code in our React app, it needs to be directly written here, or else required/imported here.</p>
      <p>We can also put any tests we'd like to associate with our components. Create React App ships with
      <a href='https://facebook.github.io/jest/' target="_blank">Jest</a>), a library for running JavaScript tests that work with React out of the box.
      For our purposes of learning to use React to build applications, we won't dive into writing tests for React apps, but
      it's nice to know that we <span class="italic">can</span> without any extra overhead.
      <span class="muted italic">(General note: Jest is awesome. Syntax is nearly identical to Mocha and Chai. Highly recommended.)</span></p>
      <h2>The Public Folder</h2>
      <p>This one should be fairly self-explanatory based on your static Express usage. This folder is primarily for containing the <span class="mono">index.html</span> that will eventually be served to users visiting our application.
      The <span class="mono">#root</span> element contains our entire rendered, React application, much like the <span class="mono">:root</span>
      pseudoelement contains all of our static HTML. When we build our React application for production, a <span class="mono">bundle.js</span> file containing all of our application's
      JavaScript is generated and added inside of the <span class="mono">index.html</span> file.</p>
      <p>We can also store files in this folder which we
      don't want to be processed by Webpack and Babel. For example, we can place static CSS files here or link to external
      CDNs in the <span class="mono">head</span> tag of the <span class="mono">index.html</span>. This particular use case is
      probably the most familiar.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>We're going to see this setup over and over again, and there isn't a need to completely memorize every aspect of the
      Create React App boilerplate right now. The most important takeaways are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Most code goes in <span class="mono">src</span></li>
        <li>The entry point into a React app is the <span class="mono">index.js</span></li>
        <li>We start up a React app in development mode with <code class="language-bash">yarn start</code>, where it live-updates.
        This is why we run it on a server, despite being served client-side to the user.</li>
      </ol>

        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>Hello World</h3>
        <p>Now that you have a high-level understanding of Create React App, you'll going to work in groups to dissect a

      <div class="review">
        <h2>Hello World Review</h2>
        <p>Let's go over this example and walk through the solution. Notice how JSX can either represent HTML primitives
          or React components, and how we use ES2015 Modules.

      <h1>CSS Frameworks and React</h1>
      <p>There exist plenty of CSS frameworks, as you're already aware. Materialize, Bootstrap, Semantic UI, you name it&mdash;they're
        all compatible with React. Of course, there is a key difference: React uses <span class="mono">className</span> instead of class.
      Why?</p>
      <p>Recall that in ES6, <span class="italic">class</span> is a reserved word. Since this word denotes a new class declaration, React uses
        <span class="mono">className</span> instead. There are some other differences between HTML and JSX we'll cover soon. As a reminder,
        since JSX isn't HTML, there are some caveats. JSX is syntactic sugar for calls to the <span class="mono">React.createElement</span>
        method, and according to <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html#specifying-children-with-jsx" target="_blank">Facebook's React Docs</a>: "JSX is closer to
        JavaScript than HTML".</p>
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>Hello Bootstrap</h3>
        <p>Check out <span class="mono">05-Stu_HelloBootstrap/README.md</span>. This file will have the instructions you need to
        create a React application which renders Bootstrap components to the page.</p>
        <p><span class="note">Note:</span> although Bootstrap is a bit dated and has fallen out of popularity,
        you can (and are encouraged to) apply this to Materialize, Semantic UI, etc.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="review">
        <h2>Hello Bootstrap Review</h2>
        <p>Let's go over this activity.</p>
        <p>The most important takeaways are how to render multiple JSX elements (a container element or array),
          void elements (self-closing tags), imports, and <span class="mono">className</span>.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>JSX</h1>
      <p>Let's take a look at <span class="mono">06-Ins_JSXVariables/src/components/JSXVariables.js</span>
      and dissect it. What's different? When we run a Webpack server with this code,
      it doesn't appear much differently when rendered.</p>
      <hr>
      <p><span class="bold">Some key points:</span> We can write comments inside of our JSX using JavaScript's multi-line comment syntax inside of curly braces. If we were
      to try and write regular JavaScript comments inside of our JSX, the code would break. In addition to being able to write comments inside of the curly braces, we can also embed JavaScript expressions. This
      works similarly to the <span class="mono">{{ }}</span> double curly braces we've worked with in Handlebars.</p>
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>JSX Variables</h3>
        <p>In this activity, you will render JavaScript expressions inside of JSX curly braces.</p>
        <p><span class="mono">07-Stu_JSXVariables/README.md</span> has the instructions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="review">
        <h2>JSX Variables Review</h2>
        <p>Let's go over the solved version of this activity.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Much like how <span class="mono">className</span> has different syntax from HTML,
      CSS looks different as well. We can import CSS directly into our components, which is really
      convenient. In doing so, we aren't saving the stylesheet to a variable. Instead, whenever we import a stylesheet, an internal style tag is
      created and added to the document.</p>
      <p>This approach may be a good idea if we want to keep our component more closely coupled to its styles. How many times have you
        worked on a project or homework assignment and had a CSS issue because of CSS that was a little messy? By separating our CSS files by component, we'll generally have smaller, more manageable stylesheets. Adding new styles
        or changing existing ones should be easier as our applications grow larger.
      </p>
      <p>Though it is <span class="italic accent">not recommended</span>, we are also able to add inline styles to JSX elements.
      We can set a <span class="mono">style</span> similarly to how we can when writing regular HTML code, but with two key differences:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>React expects the style property to be an object, rather than a string.</li>
        <li>We're using JSX curly braces to embed the style object.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Object properties are camelCased and non-numeric values are strings. Numeric values will default to pixels if a
      unit of measurement is expected. It is recommended that you conditionally render classes instead of inline styles.
      Of course, it's up to you to decide how we want to organize your component styles, but there is value in being consistent in
      whichever approach or hybrid approach you take.</p>
      <div class="student-activity">
        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>CSS Props</h3>
        <p>In this activity, you will change the appearance of an application's components using inline styles.</p>
