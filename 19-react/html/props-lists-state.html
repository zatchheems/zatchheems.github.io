      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Good evening, everyone! Today's class serves to deepen your surface-level understanding of ReactJS.
        Last time, we briefly talked about props but neglected to touch on statefulness, class components vs. pure components,
        and programmatically rendering from a list of data. We also talked in little detail about the concept of parent vs.
        child components as well as the use cases for state vs. props. Today's class will demystify some of these concepts.
      </p>
      <p>As a general note, today's concepts are, in a way, more important than the syntax itself. The syntax can be learned by repetition;
        the concepts must be understood in-depth for that syntax to make sense.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Props</h1>
      <p>Since we've begun talking about them, their usage begs the question: what exactly <span class="italic">are</span>
      props? A simple definition: <span class="note">props</span> are read-only properties passed down from a parent 
      component to child, which begs a similar question. The answer:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">// Sample component.
// Notice that props is just an object passed as a function argument
const child = props => &lt;h1>{props.foo}&lt;/h1>;

&lt;Parent>
  &lt;Child className="my-class" foo="Foo!"/>
  &lt;AnotherChild bar="42" style={/* styles are props */}>
    &lt;GrandChild baz="Props can be called anything we like!" />
  &lt;AnotherChild>
&lt;/Parent></code></pre>
      <p>In short: props are anything we want to pass to a React component&mdash;this is easy to think about as just
        passing arguments to a function, and we can conceptualize React components as JavaScript functions. Components exist
        to describe and return some part of our application's UI; props are read-only arguments to them.
      </p>
      <p>We can demo this easily in a sandbox React app. Note that since we can provide any props we'd like, we can
        reuse these components in different situations. Props can contain any datatype and other components&mdash;this is useful for
        "wrapper" elements and higher-order-components, the latter of which we'll defer on explaining until later.
      </p>
      <p>In passing props from parent to child, we do so in a top-down, unidirectional data flow.
        Keeping this in mind, we can deduce that if a prop inside of our component isn't what we expect it to be,
        the parent component must be the culprit.

        <h3>Calculator Props</h3>
        <p>Seems like we use a lot of calculator examples, huh?</p>
        <p>This activity involves writing a component that accepts props, performs arithmetic and renders the result.

        <h3>Props Review</h3>
        <p>Here's another activity on props! In this activity you will make an existing React application more DRY through the use of
        reusable components and props.</p>

        <h2>Props Review (Review)</h2>
        <p>The rendered application won't look any different, but using a reusable component makes it much more DRY.</p>
        <p>Notice the inclusion of an <span class="mono">index.js</span>. This file, when included inside of each component's
          folder, allows us to export the component from the
        <span class="mono">index.js</span>, in addition to its own file (<span class="mono">FriendCard.js</span>).
        Whenever we require/import a folder instead of a file, the folder's <span class="mono">index.js</span>1 file is required/imported by default
        (if it exists).</p>

        <h3>Component Map</h3>
        <p>In this activity, you will utilize the ES6 <span class="mono">map()</span> method in order to render JSX
          from an array of objects.</p>
        <p>Check out <span class="mono">13-Stu_ComponentMap</span> for your instructions.</p>

      <h1>Stateful Components</h1>
      <p>Thus far, we've only talked about props, and used them in functional&mdash;or pure&mdash;components. In practice,
        most components shouldn't really care too much about storing state. They get some new data, rerender what needs to
        change as their props change, and go about their lives carefree. Pure components are easy to test, debug,
        and they tend to be more reusable (even across applications) because they
        usually don't depend on how the rest of the application works.
      <p>So far, we've been using stateless components to create static, unchanging UIs. In a real application, we'd want to give
        some of our components more complex, dynamic behavior.
      I mentioned briefly that writing ES6 classes was going to be absolutely vital for your React knowledge:
      you need classes for stateful components. If we're being technical, ES6 classes are just syntactic sugar for JavaScript
      constructor functions. So...</p>
      <h2>What is "State"?</h2>
      <p>Basically, <span class="mono">state</span> is a special type of property attached to a class component that can contain data we want to associate with that
      component. Values stored in a component's state are different from regular variables because unlike regular variables, when a
      component updates its state, the React application will update itself in the browser to reflect the change wherever
      necessary.</p>
      <h2>What's the Difference?</h2>
      <p>A component can set and update its own state, whereas its props are always received from up above and considered
      immutable (can't/shouldn't be changed). Additionally, the state should be set directly
      (<code class="language-js">state = {...}</code>) only <span class="italic">once</span> in the constructor, otherwise <code class="language-js">this.setState(...)</code>
      should be used. The latter method tells React to re-render the component where necessary.</p>
      <p>Let's see an example of this in action with a simple click counter
      (<span class="mono">14-Ins_BasicState</span>).</p>
      <p>Class components need a <span class="mono">render()</span> method and normally use a constructor.
      Constructors aren't strictly necessary, but you'll be using them more often than not. There are tons of different
      built-in functions that React gives us, like <span class="mono">componentDidMount</span>,
      <span class="mono">componentWillReceiveProps</span>, etc. These are all easily referenced in the API docs.</p>
      <p>Overall:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We use state to associate data with a component and keep track of any values we want to update the UI when changed.</li>
        <li>We can define methods on a class component and pass them as props.</li>
        <li>The <span class="mono">onClick</span> prop can be used to set a click event listener to an element.</li>
      </ul></p>
