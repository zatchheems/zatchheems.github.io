      <h2>This session, we want you:</h2>
        <li>To understand the value of Git version control</li>
        <li>To gain initial exposure to the concept of "adding, committing, and pushing" code to GitHub</li>
        <li>To gain initial exposure to HTML/CSS and how the two are linked using element selectors</li>

      <h1>What is Git? How does it work?</h1>
      <p>Here's a good link GitHub uses to teach the basics:
        <a href='https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/' target="_blank">Hello World Activity</a>
      </p>

      <h2>Git is an ideal platform for collaboration.</h2>
      <p>Teams are often large or separately by hundreds of miles. A centralized platform for collaboration is key! Otherwise,
        we're stuck overwriting each other's changes, your own edits may get ignored, app-breaking bugs are costly to fix, etc.
      </p>
      <blockquote>We have multiple people accessing a set of files for the sake of collaboration.
        How do we make sure we're not stepping on each-other's toes? How do we share these
        files with each other? What is the development process like?</blockquote>
        <div class='line-break'></div>
      <p>Each collaborator can do a number of things on a git repository. You can upload files, download new edits to existing files,
        create new branches (we'll get to what this means), fork projects, roll back changes...</p>
        <p>The basics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>git clone</code>: clone an existing repository (to begin)</li>
          <li><code>git add</code>: add one or more files for inclusion in Git</li>
          <li><code>git commit</code>: state the changes you've made, store them in local repo</li>
          <li><code>git push</code>: send changes to hosting service</li>
          <li><code>git pull</code>: get freshest version of repo</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How about a quick demo?</h2>
        <!-- "Pre"formatted tags. Whitespace is preserved within them. -->
        <pre>git clone https://github.com/.../my-repo.git local-repo
git add style.css
git commit -m "Added fancy styling on section tags"
git push -u origin master
git pull</pre>

      <form method="POST" id="sampleForm" name="sampleForm">

      <h1>HyperText Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
      <h2>HTML and CSS!</h2>
      <p>Let's go back to VS Code for this one.</p>
      <p>We'll go over form elements and some less common tags. Remember that you don't have to remember every tag!
        Sometimes you'll only be using a tag once in a while.
