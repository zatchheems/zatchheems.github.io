      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Good evening, all! Today's class marks a momentous occasion: you have
        now <span class="italic">finished learning the Mern stack!</span> Your React instruction
        ends today as well&mdash;of course, this means that the rest of your learning is in your
        hands. Learning only ends when you want it to: as a full-stack engineer, if you know several
        frameworks and the methodologies behind them, you can learn
        <span class="mid-accent">anything you want</span>.
      </p>
      <p>This means that if you think Vue.js is interesting, or perhaps a Redis DB, or maybe even
        an Express alternative piques your interest, you are encouraged to go forth and learn whatever
        tools you think are right for the job. This doesn't just go for the final project: this goes for
        the entirety of your careers as developers. Recall that "flavor-of-the-month" technologies
        come and go, but you all are capable of grasping new technologies swiftly and efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>You're ready for this! &#x1F320;</p>
      <p>That being said, today's class will solely be for review and project/homework time. No new instruction!
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Databases and React Review</h1>
      <p>This is your time for anything you'd like to go over since the end of Project 2.
        You are urged to ask questions, say what you want reviewed, and ask for any solutions to previous activities you'd
        like.
      </p>
      <p>After we review, we will have homework time! &#x2728;</p>

    <h1>Homework Time!</h1>
    <h3 class="mid-accent">Basically, mini office hours. Get help with whatever you need!</h3>
    <hr>

  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>What's Next?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Final Projects</li>
      <li>Remaining Topics:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Python/Django</li>
        <li>Computer Science Fundamentals</li>
        <li>Basics in Other Languages</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Job Workshops</li>
      <li>Demo Day! &#x1F389;</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="no-letter">The major takeaway here: <span class="note">never stop learning!</span>
    You've already absorbed all of the knowledge you came for. Everything else is icing on the cake. This is your time
    to shine!</p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p class="no-letter">Here are the requirements for the final project:</p>

      <li>Must have a <span class="note">polished frontend / UI</span></li>
      <li>Must have folder structure that meets <span class="note">MVC</span> Paradigm</li>
      <li>Must meet <span class="note">good quality coding standards</span> (indentation, scoping, naming)</li>
      <li>Must <span class="note">not expose sensitive API key</span> information on the server</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are somewhat flexible! Do what you want. Talk to us and get our input.
      If you have an idea, run with it! <span class="mid-accent">This is the time to prove yourself.</span>
    </p>

    <h2>Deliverables:</h2>
    <h3>Week 1: Action Plan</h3>
    <p>A detailed plan of action with the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An overview of the intended application and <span class="italic">why</span> you feel it's valuable.</li>
      <li>A breakdown of roles by group member.</li>
      <li>A schedule for completion of various tasks.</li>
      <li>A screenshot of your Project Management Board (any kind!) that shows breakdown of tasks assigned to group members
      with a schedule.</li>
      <li>A set of <span class="italic">detailed</span> screen-by-screen design layouts with annotations describing all UI/UX components and all data
      relevant to the screen. Use the mockup tools we discussed way, way back in static HTML.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Week 2: MVP!</h3>
    <p>A functioning <span class="note">minimal viable product</span>&mdash;i.e., a prototype version of your app that shows the intended function. This
    should be as close to a working app as possible and include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A 5-7 minute presentation that discusses what your app is, what it does, and how it works. You will be presenting to
      instructors and TAs during class.</li>
      <li>A screenshot of your Project Management Board of choice that shows breakdown of tasks assigned to group members
      with a schedule. This should be updated to reflect remaining priorities and completed tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Week 3: Polish, Polish and More Polish</h3>
    <p>A significantly more polished version of the app. This should literally seem like an app that you would submit.</p>
    <p>Include a summary of significant issues faced to date and their resolution.</p>
    <p>Provide a detailed description of each person's contributions.</p>
    <p>Submit a detailed plan that describes remaining efforts. This should describe remaining issues like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Iceboxed/Stretch Features</li>
      <li>Bugs</li>
      <li>Enhancements</li>
      <li>UI Polishing</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Week 4: Presentations!</h3>
    <p>A 7-10 minute demonstration of your app.</p>
    <p>More on this as we get closer to the end.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1 class="mid-accent">Questions?</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The rest of the class will be spent conceptualizing the final app.
      Form your groups and think about what you'll be creating over the course of the next month.
    </p>
    <p>By the time the class ends, you should send us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What the app will do</li>
      <li>What technologies you'll implement</li>
      <li>Who will be responsible for what</li>
      <li>Who will be responsible for each part of deliverable #1</li>
    </ul>

      <h1>Final Project Time!</h1>
      <p>Brainstorm, conceptualize, mock up, sketch, chat, and anything else final project
        related. This is your time!
      </p>
      <p>As a reminder: by the time the class ends, you should send us:</p>

    <section>
      <h1>React Checkpoint</h1>
      <p>You know the drill! This won't affect your final grade, ability to graduate,
        or standing in the class whatsoever. These checkpoints allow us as an instructional
        team to see how everyone is doing.

      <p>The link will be Slacked out to you.</p>
