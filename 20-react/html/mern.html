      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Good evening, all! Today's class involves tying together a whole slew of technologies to fully comprise the entirety of our dev environment:
        <span class="note">the Mern stack</span>. This involves connecting Create React App to an Express backend, passing data back and forth between
        front-end and back-end, and using React Router. Today's activities will contain significantly more boilerplate than the previous React lessons;
        it will take a bit of focus to pay slightly less attention to this code as you accomplish given objectives.
      </p>
      <p>There is little new material here but plenty of opportunities to review what we've covered the past several classes.</p>
      <p>Before we begin: any questions? Comments? Concerns? How do you feel about React?</p>
    </section>

      <h1>Mern Demo</h1>
      <p>Let's begin today's class with a demo of a full Mern app. As a general reminder: <abbr title="Mongo, Express, React, Node" class="note">Mern</abbr>
        stands for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>MongoDB</li>
          <li>Express</li>
          <li>ReactJS</li>
          <li>NodeJS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since beginning to learn React ,we've only been working with front-end code. We haven't set up a database, or an Express
          server; we've just been working on the front-end with React. Though <span class="bold">we have</span> been using a dev server with Create React App,
          this server exists simply for live reloading and compiling. Recall that everything gets transpiled and minified into a
          <span class="mono">bundle.js</span>&mdash;this is what gets deployed. In most real applications, we'll also need a production quality server such as
          Express for connecting to a database or setting up API routes.</p>
          <p>You will be provided with a Create React App Express boilerplate that you can use for homework or projects. There's no need to completely understand
            every aspect of the code in order to be productive, but we're going to walk through an example to give you a working high level understanding.</p>
            <p>Let's take a look at <span class="mono">07-Ins_Mern</span>. Within the <span class="mono">client</span> folder, there's something weird here.
              Unusually, we have not one, but two <span class="mono">package.json</span> files, each with different sets of dependencies. Running
              <code class="language-bash">yarn install</code> will install two different servers to be used together. We'll also want to pay attention to the
              <span class="mono">proxy</span> setting in Create React App and pore through the two package files.</p>
              <p>We have our usual <code class="language-bash">yarn start</code> to run the app, and also <code class="language-bash">yarn build</code>
                for a static version of our React app that can be deployed.</p>

                  <p>In this example, you will complete a recipe finder application by adding code to render a list of recipes retrieved

                      stuff you've already done before.

                      <p>When it comes to homework assignments and final projects, make sure you have deployment figured out
                      sooner rather than later&mdash;many of you have already figured this out. There are now more reasons why
                      a Heroku deployment could fail than there ever have been before, you are urged to not
                      try and push to Heroku for the first time right before an assignment is due.</p>
                      <p>Don't be afraid to ask the instructional staff (us!) for help, either over Slack or during office hours.</p>
