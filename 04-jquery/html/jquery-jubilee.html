        <h1>Administrivia</h1>
        <p>How do we feel about JavaScript thus far? Questions, comments,
          concerns, laments, anxieties, exclamations, expletives, cheers, jeers,
          fears?
        </p>
        <p>How about the homework?</p>
        <p>If you feel like we're going really, really fast, <span class='italic'>we are!</span>
        We're flying through JavaScript and jQuery.</p>
        <p>This is a reminder that what you're doing
        right now is incredible: you're learning a completely different language with its own
        syntax, standards, and paradigms that are totally new and unfamiliar, so it's natural
        to feel a little overwhelmed. Remember that you don't have to memorize
        everything: that's what documentation is for. Learn syntax and general structure/patterns,
        then put them together into something you can use.</p>
        <p>In short: you probably don't realize how much you've learned in such a short
          amount of time. This stuff is challenging and you're killin' it! &#x1F320;</p>
        <h2>Today's Lesson</h2>
        <p>We're going to be showcasing some of jQuery's greatest strengths by continuing our
          study of JavaScript DOM manipulation. Remember that we want to add event handlers, select
          DOM nodes and modify contents and properties so that we can <span class='note'>change
            the DOM on the fly</span>.

          <p>Our first activity will be making a kind of browser game using jQuery.</p>
          <p>I'll demonstrate how it works first. Think about what you'll need to accomplish
            this behavior.

          <p>We're going to pseudocode out the game's logic and structure.</p>
          <p>Then, let's talk about it! Let's hear from multiple people about how they
            thought about the development process.

          <h3>The real deal</h3>
          <p>Dissect the given code and write additional code to create a new power for

          <p>Reference the jQuery API documentation
            <a href="https://api.jquery.com/" target="_blank">(https://api.jquery.com/)</a> to see what you'll
          need that you haven't learned yet.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><span class="italic">Click to…</span> Stretch Captain Planet!</li>
            <li><span class="italic">Click to…</span> Trigger a maniacal laugh!</li>

        <h1>jQuery Recap</h1>
        <p>jQuery's selector syntax "captures" HTML DOM elements using <code>$(...)</code>.
        It comes bundled with all sorts of useful functions, some of which are properties of
        these selected objects. When including <code>$()</code>, objects are treated as jQuery objects.
        Thus, <code>this</code> and <code>$(this)</code> are different things. Use the latter syntax
        to call jQuery-specific functions on these objects.</p>
        <pre class="brush: javascript">
// Select an element, store it
var asciiTitle = $("#ascii-title");

// Select an element, change its CSS
$("#todo").css("color","darkorange");

// Can also animate changes
asciiTitle.animate({
  "font-size": "2vw"
}, 1200);

// Append to all divs with class "student-activity"
$(".student-activity").append("&lt;small>Activity time over!!&lt;/small>");

// jQuery-style for each. Also works for objects!
$.each(items, function(key, val){
  console.log("Key "+key+" has value "+val+".");
});

// Add event handler for click
$("h1").on("click", function(e){
  $(this).animate({
    "font-size": "3em"
  },500);
});

        </pre>
        <div class="student-activity">
          <h2>Student activity!</h2>
          <p>Let's look at another game, then you try to build it! Check out <code>11-FridgeGame</code>.</p>
          <p>Working in groups of 3, complete the code for the fridge activity such that:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>JavaScript dynamically generates buttons for each of the letters on the screen.</li>
              <li>Clicking any of the buttons leads the <span class='bold'>same</span> letter to be displayed on the screen.</li>
              <li>Hitting the clear button erases all of the letters from the fridge.</li>
            </ol>
          <p><span class="note">Note:</span> This is a challenging exercise. You may want one person to type, while the other two
            watch over to catch bugs and/or research necessary snippets.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="activity">
          <h2>Solution and another example...</h2>
          <p>The solution includes creating an array that holds all of the letters, a
            <code>for</code> loop to take letters from the array, associate it with a 
            data-attribute <span class='gray italic'>(super convenient!)</span> and text, then append them to the page.
            We'll go over this code.
          </p>
          <hr class='line-break'>
          <p>Let's look at the files in <code>12-CrystalExample</code>. Much of these files
          are similar to your homework assignment due this week!</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <div class='page-break'>
        <h1>Break time!</h1>
      </div>
      <section>
        <h1>Lexical scope</h1>
        <p><span class="note">Warning:</span> this section is very theory-heavy.</p>
        <p>We define scope using curly braces <code class='selector'>{}</code>, which denote blocks of code.</p>
        <p>Remember when we talked about local and global variables? We have to be extremely careful not to mix up
          our variable names. Variables overwritten within functions may overwrite global variables.
          This topic is in the same ballpark. Variables can be declared within functions, and
          <span class="bold">so can other functions</span>! They are also a valid return type.</p>
        <p>Functions that have nested functions are the <span class="note">parent</span> functions;
          nested functions are <span class="note">child</span> functions.</p>
        <p>Child functions have access to parent-described variables, but <span class="italic">
          not</span> vice versa, so if a parent tries to access a child-described variable, it will
          likely return <code>undefined</code>.
        </p>
        <p>Here's an example of what we mean by nesting functions:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: javascript">
// Examples from Mozilla docs
// &lthttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures>

function init() {
  var name = 'Mozilla'; // name is a local variable created by init
  function displayName() { // displayName() is the inner function, a closure
    alert(name); // use variable declared in the parent function    
  }
  displayName();    
}
init();

/*********************************************
**********************************************/

// More useful example
function makeAdder(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  };
}

var add5 = makeAdder(5);
var add10 = makeAdder(10);

console.log(add5(2));  // 7
console.log(add10(2)); // 12
        </pre>
        <small>(This stuff has a tendency to melt brains, and is generally the bane
          of people who who dislike JavaScript—right next to equality vs.
          equivalence. Ask plenty of questions.)</small>
