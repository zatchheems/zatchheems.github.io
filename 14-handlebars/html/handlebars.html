      <h1>Administrivia</h1>
      <p>Good evening everyone, and welcome to week 14! Now that you're pros at routing, it's time to introduce a new
        tool to really simplify front-end development: templating engines. We'll be taking a look at Handlebars
        in particular. This will be the final component you will need to learn in order to complete your homework.
      </p>
      <p>Today's class will focus on sending MySQL data from back-end to front-end using Express, understanding semantic templating using
        Handlebars, and creating an Express connection to a front-end application, which will then print data to the screen using Handlebars.
      </p>
      <p>Before we begin a warmup activity, I'll demo the next homework for you shortly.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Express Activities</h1>
      <p>Before we begin, are there any lingering questions about Express? Routing in general?
        <code>GET</code> vs. <code>POST</code> vs. <code>PUT</code> etc.? Methodologies behind the whole thing? Ask away!</p>

        <h2>Student activity!</h2>
        <h3>Express Calculator</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You will create an Express calculator application with one get route that is able to take in three parameters: an operation and two numbers.</li>
          <li>There are four operation values which a user may use: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</li>
          <li>When the route is hit, your browser should display the result of the math operation.</li>
          <li>For example, when the user goes to the url <a href="http://localhost:3000/add/10/1">http://localhost:3000/add/10/1</a>, the page should display 11.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Express Calculator Review</h2>
        <p>Let's go through the code for this line-by-line.</p>
        <p>We know we want different routes for the four mathematical operations&mdash;all we need are the different operators and operands.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The reason we aren't jumping directly into Handlebars yet is because we want to make sure everyone is comfortable with Express.
        Since the former simply builds on the latter, it is imperative that your knowlege is solid before we continue. Express is absolutely
        <span class="italic">vital</span> for the types of back-end components we want to build.
      </p>
      <p>Please do not hesitate to ask questions, even during the next activity.</p>

        <h2>Instructor activity...</h2>
        <p>The next thing I'll show you relies on MySQL for data. I'll run a SQL file then open up a companion JavaScript file.</p>
        <p>As always, I'll need to run <code class="language-bash">npm install</code> before trying to run the file.</p>
        <p>When we run it, we'll inspect the HTML and how it's being generated, then sent to the browser.</p>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <p>Create a seinfeld_db database with an actors table.</p>
        <p>The actors table will have a column for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code class="language-sql">id (PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT int)</code></li>
          <li><code class="language-sql">name (varchar)</code></li>

          <li><code class="language-sql">attitude (varchar)</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Add in four actors with different names, coolness_points, and attitudes.</p>
        <p>Create a Node Application with Express, MySQL, and Body Parser with three Express routes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>/cast</code> route that will display all the actors and their data ordered by their id's.</li>
          <li><code>/coolness-chart</code> route that will display all the actors and their data ordered by their coolness points.</li>
          <li><code>/attitude-chart/:att</code> route that will display all the actors for a specific type of attitude.</li>

      <h2>SQL + HTML = Nope.</h2>
      <p>Why wouldn't we want to combine data from MySQL with HTML?</p>
      <p>The main reason we have is that you'd have to write out a large amount of HTML, which will quickly become an unmanageable
        rats' nest. This is an awful lot to keep within a server-side JS file.
      </p>
      <p>After the break, we'll cover a great alternative: a means to template back-end data on the front-end instead.</p>

    <section>
      <h1>Introduction to Handlebars</h1>
      <p>As a general note, <span class="note">Handlebars</span> is my personal favorite templating engine. It's one of many, actually&mdash;alongside
        Pug <span class="italic muted">(F.K.A. Jade)</span> it is one of the most popular solutions to having to type out all of your HTML by hand,
        barring Emmet abbreviations, macros, etc. Handlebars is what is known as a "Semantic Templating" framework for JavaScript and HTML. Frameworks like these are used
        as a replacement to constructing long strings of HTML within JavaScript code while also providing programmers with a
        simpler method through which to dynamically create or to fill HTML elements.</p>
      <p>What makes Handlebars unique is its introduction of moustache brackets, e.g.
        <code class="language-javascript">{{FOO}}</code>, to directly inject data into our front-end. No concatenation, no problem. It's slightly
        prettier than ES6 template strings as well. You can also use triple moustache brackets, e.g.
        <code class="language-javascript">{{<p>Ham, spam and eggs</p>}}</code>, to insert unescaped HTML. (You can take a look at the
        <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank">Handlebars site</a> to get a feel for this syntax if you're struggling.)</p>
        <p>Other templating engines leverage similar ideas as well for the sake of scrubbing user input: if someone types in raw HTML, we don't have
          to worry about <code class="language-html">&lt;script></code> tags and other nastiness.
        </p>
      <h2>Setting Up Handlebars</h2>
      <p>There's a small bit of overhead besides just using <code class="language-bash">npm install handlebars</code> to get everything set up.
        For one, we need a <span class="note">Views</span> folder containing Handlebars files, then a <span class="note">Layouts</span>
        folder.
      </p>
      <p>I'll show you what an example folder structure would look like, then we'll check out the code.</p>

        <h3>Explaining Lunches Application</h3>
        <p>Check out <span class="mono">04-HandlebarsLunch</span> and open it up. Discuss how the code works in
        partners.</p>
        <p>After you finish going over <code>main</code> and <code>index</code>, have a look at <code>all-lunches</code>
          to figure out how it works as well.</p>
        <p>If you're confused, the <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank">Handlebars site</a> is a great help.</p>

        <h3>Ben and Jerry's App</h3>
        <p>In this activity, you are going to be creating your own Ben and Jerry's App where users can see all of the different flavors
        Ben and Jerry's have to offer while also getting specific information on a flavor by searching for it within the URL.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">var icecreams = [
  {name: 'vanilla', price: 10, awesomeness: 3},
  {name: 'chocolate', price: 4, awesomeness: 8},
  {name: 'banana', price: 1, awesomeness: 1},
  {name: 'greentea', price: 5, awesomeness: 7},
  {name: 'jawbreakers', price: 6, awesomeness: 2},
];</code></pre>
        <p>Don't use MySQL for this assignment! Use the <span class="mono">icecreams</span> variable above as your data.
          Add the variable to your <span class="mono">server.js</span>
        file.</p>
         <p>
           Using Handlebars and express, create a route called <code>/icecreams/:name</code>. When the route is hit, it will display the name,
          price and awesomeness for that specific ice cream.
         </p>
        <p>
          Create an <code>/icecreams</code> route. It will loop over all the ice creams and display them all to the user.
